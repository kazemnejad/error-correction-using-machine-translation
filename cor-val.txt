First , you have changed the actor .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
I would prefer a log cabin and I hope that then I will have enough room for all the things I will bring with me .
I 'm looking forward to receiving your decision .
I went to the Circle Theatre yesterday , to see the play `` Over The Rainbow '' and I must say that I was rather disappointed .
Yours sincerely
Your faithfully
I really hope to see you soon .
I am looking forward to seeing you all soon .
I would not dare to calculate how much I have spent on those things without thinking . However , it was not bad . My mum always told me that I had n't earned enough money so I should n't have spent it in the wrong way .
However , there was one person who told me he was n't happy at all with the phone , because he used to write a lot , especially at Christmas when he wanted to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phones him , ending a very old tradition .
On the other hand , there 're some things that remain the same . The toilet should remain the same as people need to use it daily and nothing can replace it . Second , there should be friends and family members in the home to provide joy and fun . Since friends and family members wo n't change or be replaced by anything .
Yours sincerely ,
Secondly , the musical was not started on time . It was going to start at 19.30 . However , It was started 45 minutes later . After all , I missed my return train after the show .
In the afternoon I was sitting around , waiting for the pop groups . Then at five o'clock my favourite band `` Tristania '' arrived .
Thank you for the programme you have organised for our visit to London . We think it will be a very interesting trip , especially the sightseeing by bus .
I was starting to sell the tickets when an organiser told me to go into the dressing room . They needed one person to put the clothes into a wardrobe . It was the dressing room of Mylene Farmer . What do you think of that ? I was so excited ! Unfortunately , I did n't see her but it allowed me to talk with her manager , John , and her musicians . They were all very kind and pleasant . It was a big moment for me . These people are like us , they just have a special job with special times . Next year , if it is possible , I would like go back with you . They will organise the same pop concert but with another singer . I look forward to hearing from you soon .
It seems to me that all these failures were your fault , because you were responsible for the organisation of the show . I think you ought to have postponed the show and reimbursed me for the ticket price . However , considering that I saw the show , I would like to get a 50 % refund .
In my opinion , clothes will not change so much , because fashion is an eternal cycle . You will always find the same basic clothes , but I think that it will be the materials which will change .
What should be filmed .
For many years scientific and technological breakthroughs have changed our lives . I think that the more technological developments we have , the more comfortable lives we enjoy . Amazingly , we can find that there are more and more computer users . So life is much faster and more convenient than before .
I am writing to you to complain about the problem that happened in the play called `` Over the rainbow '' , and why I would like to get some money back .
At one o'clock I had a break . At this point I promised myself that I would never do this awful job again . The food was delicious and fortunately I did not have to pay for it .
In conclusion , journalists should respect their lives and always write accurate reports .
Rod was arrested that day and was sent to prison . He was then killed by the other man who escaped that day and was caught soon afterwards .
First of all I would like to thank you . Now I am going to give you some further information : I would like to travel only in July because I am a student in high school and this is the most important year of my life . I am studying for the university entrance exams and I have to study until the end of June and then at the end of June I will have the university entrance exam and after that , in July , I am going to be alright .
I hope that you will find this composition interesting .
70 % of students said that the acting lesson should be filmed as the students attending this lesson , are not only excited but also very active . Additionally , 15 % of students answered that they want the presentation lesson to be filmed . The reason why they choose this lesson is that every student in their turn at presentation does his or her best .
And if this is a problem for me , imagine how bad a very fat woman ( or man ) would feel .
I wish we had never chosen your show . In fact , after only having gone into the theatre , I realized that the advertisement I had read was probably about another show .
There will be the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear on show . In addition we will have the opportunity to see the newest make-up and hairstyles .
Best wishes .
With the help of some modern technology our daily lives would not be so difficult .
Yours faithfully
Inventions have affected all our lives
So the whole fashion industry will work to make clothes more useful , practical and comfortable . What will we have ? Breathing jackets and shirts with air conditioning .
Technology is good as long as it gives people more free time , but what would happen if free time became your life ?
YOURS FAITHFULLY ,
I look forward to receiving your reply
SECOND I GOT TO THE THEATRE AT 19.20 BECAUSE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT IT CLEARLY STATES THAT THE SHOW STARTS AT 19.30 , AND I GOT REALLY MAD WHEN I LOOKED AT MY WATCH AND NOTICED THAT I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 40 ( FORTY ) MINUTES AND THE SHOW HAD N'T STARTED YET ... I MEAN IT WAS AMAZING !
Love from
My wife and I had decided to eat at the theatre restaurant after the play . It turned out to be impossible : the restaurant was closed and we did n't even receive an explanation .
Yours sincerely ,
Thank you very much for your letter . I am very happy about having won the competition . I have several things to tell you and some questions about the camp .
Of course , shopping is not always so unpleasant , but sometimes it is simply better to stay at home .
Dear Ms Ryan ,
She does not know when she can speak or not speak . We are so worried about her future . She has not a lot of friends because of this point .
The clothes will be more comfortable but less decorative . People will put on fitted suits such as diving suits or perhaps wear nothing . For instance , people will not care about what other people see . Or maybe we will not need to see each other any more .
I played Basketball at school for about two years . I am rather good at it . I also had Painting as my main subject at school for five years . I like painting very much , and I think I am good at Painting . I paint a lot in my free time . I prefer painting landscapes and fantasy pictures .
On top of this we intended to go to the theatre restaurant , which was closed because of building activities .
Dear Sir ,
If I find something special you will be able to visit in three hours I will call you .
However , shopping is entertaining if you do n't know what else to do . You can discover a lot of things if you are abroad and learn a lot about the life of local people . Moreover , it is fun to try on many different types of clothes and to see what you look like in various clothes , especially if you are in a foreign country . It can be fun !
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I would be grateful if you could let me have the above information as soon as possible . Thank you once again for giving me this good news !
On the other hand , people tend to wear natural clothes today , made of cotton , wool etc . This tendency may result in rejecting synthetics completely .
I just received your letter with the good news . I am very happy about winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go , but I can only travel in July because I have to work until the end of June .
After hard work , we want to go home to have our corner where we are able to rest and relax .
Dear Sir/Madam
Dear Kim ,
I should not forget mobile phones . If I feel like talking to a friend I just have to call him and wherever he is I will be able to get through to him . Several European companies like Nokia or Ericsson are focusing on mobiles and I have been told that in a couple of years it will be possible to send an e-mail either from a computer or from a mobile , which is going to be great .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
As you know , I was there to help with the running of the concert and there were a lot of different things to do .
The outside lights were broken and I could n't see anything .
Owing to the bad organisation of the last play that was performed in your theatre in recent weeks , I want to tell you about some incorrect information that I found in your advertisement , as a result of which all the problems that I had occurred .
Sincerely ,
Dear sir ,
For me , I think people 's homes may not be built on the ground . The homes will be built in the sky - so as to save more land to build the other buildings . As the homes will be built in the sky , it will save a lot of electricity as solar energy will be used .
Dear ...
To : The Principal of Westminster College , Mr Robertson .
First I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do it in a hurry or as a duty . If you have to run from one shop to another , always looking at your watch , going shopping is a terrible activity .
Thirdly , I would prefer to swim and play tennis , because I have been doing this since I was I child , and I think I am very good at each activity .
Look forward to hearing from you soon .
To begin with , I 'd like to underline how the importance of technology has increased in a couple of years . With the end of the Second world war and the beginning of economic prosperity , many goods like TVs , washing machines , etc . became cheaper and more available . Nowadays , the Internet and the mobile phone , with the development of satellite communication , seem to take the lead . Do they affect my daily life ?
Reaching the island , he and his friends fought bravely against the devils . They finally succeeded in defeating the devils , and took back all the money and treasure . After that , they went home .
I want to ask you about money . How much money do I need and do I have to have it in cash or can I use a credit card ? Could you let me know about the weather because I do n't know what kind of clothes I should take . Would you send me your answer as quickly as it is possible . I look forward to seeing you soon . Thank you
On behalf of the class
Modern technology has changed my daily life in many ways .
Moreover , the show was said to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:15 .
I 'm looking forward to getting your letter soon .
Yours sincerely
Music is a traditional subject in our school . Everyone in our school can play at least one instrument , so music lessons should be filmed to show music is part of our school 's daily life .
I look forward to meeting you at the conference .
Love ,
Dear Sir ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , but she was her best friend and she had to trust her . Anna told her again : `` Pat do n't tell anyone please , especially my brother , everything would be ruined then '' . And Pat answered : `` Do n't worry I wo n't tell anyone '' .
I would like to travel in July because I have to go back to my country in August . And I 'm sure that the weather in July will be lovely !
I am writing to complain about the musical show which is called OVER THE RAINBOW . I saw the show on the 17th of July .
Regarding the best dates for my visit , I wonder if it would be possible to come in July because I 'm going to sit a very important exam at the end of June . Two weeks in the USA would be a great opportunity for me to relax after that .
In there , students can have fun in the recreation areas , can watch a film and eat all kinds of food and go shopping . We can have fun as well . And that 's why I recommend this place to you .
And computers are the most important product of technology . In the world , people spend the whole day playing with computers . Not only as a hobby . They use computers for their work . They communicate with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers . Sometimes they do n't go to their offices . They write their secret notes on computers . Computers hold them in their memory . But in the past people had to use lots of notebooks and they also had to find places to hide them .
Before using e-mail , I used to write letters and sometimes used the telephone . However , I 've found e-mail is better than those means of communication , because as soon as I send my message , they receive it . In other words , I can also receive their reply quickly . It 's really useful when I need a quick reply .
I also agree with you about the ticket 's price . In fact , it was really a reasonably-priced ticket , excellent because you could go to all the events just with it . And that 's the reason why lots of people came .
In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort into choosing things and making decisions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depending on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested in pleasing .
I 'm writing to answer your question about the rules in my life , at school and at home .
However , it was a great job . I have n't hade such a great experience before . I could see a great number of pop stars in front of us . Can you believe that ?
Shopping does not just affect us mentally , but also physically . It 's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping . Think of the awful crowds , the busy car parks , polluted air in the city centres and mile-long queues in front of the cash desks . I do n't think anyone really likes to face them . But once you get there , they 're just inevitable , are n't they ?
Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions .
Yours sincerely ,
b ) basketball and football games .
Thank you for your letter . I will try my best to answer the questions .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
I THINK THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ALL HUMAN BEINGS . MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ME IN SEVERAL WAYS . I MEAN THE MORE THE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ; THE MORE COMFORTCOMFORTABLE WE GET . NOW WITH MODERN MACHINES I CAN MAKE BETTER USE OF MY TIME . IF I AM LATE TO GO TO TRAINING AND I HAVE N'T EATEN YET I JUST TAKE MY FOOD AND PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVE OVEN . ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS COMPUTERS . I THINK THEY ARE SOME OF THE MOST ADVANCED MACHINES IN THE WORLD . YOU CAN LIVE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN A HOUSE WITHOUT GOING OUT , JUST BY USING THE INTERNET . IT HAS ALSO HELPED ME WITH MY HOMEWORK . I MEAN IT 'S INCREDIBLE THE TIME YOU WASTE BY DOING SOMETHING WITHOUT A COMPUTER . BUT I THINK ALSO THAT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE GET MORE COMFORTABLE SO THAT MAKES ME A PASSIVE PERSON AND NOT SO ACTIVE . THIS CAN BE BAD TOO BECAUSE IF I GET USED TO BEING COMFORTABLE , WHEN I NEED TO DO HARD WORK I WO N'T BE ABLE TO .
Tears ran down my face as I admitted having stolen . I was surprised that my father did n't watch me but I soon understood that he was ignoring me .
You may be surprised to receive a letter from us . All the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for three days . This trip would give us the chance to see London and to improve our English . We all like the daily programme for the three days . In the morning , we will have the chance to see some of the sights of London by bus , for example , the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery .
Clothes are a very interesting subject to study . If you travel around you can see a lot of difference still between different cultures .
Thank you for your letter which arrived this morning .
This will be a tough challenge for this new century .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Today there are children who do n't know anything about nature and its things .
Yours sincerely ,
You are the theatre 's manager so I suppose you are the right person to complain to .
Yours sincerely ,
I arrived at the right time ( 19.30 ) that evening but the play , which was 'Over The Rainbow ' , started almost an hour late . And nobody told me why !
Recommendations ?
About the trip , I think it would be preferable to do it in July , which is a holiday period and so I wo n't have any special obligations . While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent , so I can be closer to nature . Anyway the accommodation is not a big problem for me , because I will be away most of the time . Spending a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worst thing to do , especially during a holiday ! Moreover I would like it if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball . Any little tournaments of this kind would be great .
We can consider this problem from two different points of view . On the one hand , these people chose to become public figures . If we do n't want to be in the newspapers , we do n't go into politics or the movies ! But , on the other hand , everybody has the right to have a secret garden , the right to be with his/her family without being disturbed by journalists and photographers . The case of Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach extremes .
In the letter you said that the accommodation provided can be either a tent or a log cabin . I would prefer to stay in a tent so that I will have the chance to be in contact with nature as well as the scenery around the camp .
I have just received your letter of congratulations and I am writing to you in order to provide you with information you need .
On the positive side , you and the group will be able to learn more about Welsh artworks which are presented on the wall , on the door and some furniture . The building itself looks splendid and beautiful .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
Firstly , it is a good idea that the Festival is international . But in the advertisement it was said that the artists were from all over the world but I saw only six nationalities .
Swimming is an activity I have done since I was a boy . I still enjoy swimming , especially when it 's in the sea , although I never took part in competitions , which means I go swimming just for fun .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
As you can understand , it was a dreadful time and I want my money back as a consolation for the disappointment I had .
Finally I would like to do basketball and swimming , because in my school I used to do those sports a lot . I still do so even now at a sports center , but not much .
THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN RACE IS THE HISTORY OF WORLD CONQUEST . THAT SAID , TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MAN 'S EVOLUTION . FURTHERMORE , DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES , THERE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS TECHNOLOGICAL EXPLOSION . WHILE THE XIX CENTURY GAVE US THE STEAM ENGINE , FACTORIES AND THE ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB , THIS CENTURY HAS GIVEN US NUCLEAR ENERGY ( AND SADLY ATOMIC WEAPONS ) , THE COMPUTER , THE INTERNET AND TELEVISION .
I WAIT FOR YOUR ANSWER , AND FOR OUR MONEY BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE .
About the programme , we suggest seeing the show on the Tuesday morning and afterwards going shopping . As far as we are concerned , we prefer to see the Science Museum rather than the National Art Gallery . We also suggest visiting the Science Museum on Wednesday morning and in the afternoon , if some of us are interested , we could see the National Art Gallery .
Some go just to kill time ; others to look at something new . I am in the third group - beforehand I think of what I will buy and go straight to the department I need .
Rie Tanizaki
As regards accommodation , I would like to stay in tents , because I used to go on holiday with my friends and stay in tents . It is just wonderful .
During the camp I would like to practise my swimming ( I have attended swimming lessons for 3 years ) and also I would like to learn how to take some good photos . ( I have no experience ! )
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE NICE SURPRISE YOU 'VE GIVEN ME . I JUST CA N'T BELIEVE THAT I WON THE FIRST PRIZE . HERE IS THE INFORMATION YOU ASKED FOR :
First , your advert led me to expect Danny Brook ( who is a very good singer I appreciate very much ) but he was not there . An unknown actor was singing , not in tune - awful for my ears - ( poor Tina Truelove ! such a professional singer with a beginner ! )
- CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME HOW THE WEATHER IS THEN , SO I CAN TAKE THE PROPER CLOTHES ?
Brian found out what had happened and at first he was angry with Pat but then he thanked him . Jane and Brian were very happy .
From : An Soo Kim
Nowadays , technology is the most useful tool that human beings have . It affects everyone who lives on this planet and every activity done on it .
Yours sincerely
Faithfully yours
My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about some things that happened at the performance of the show Over the Rainbow , which took place in your establishment , The Circle Theatre , which made me feel very upset .
Dear Helen Ryan :
The thing I really liked was helping the artists and talking to them . Okay , they screamed at me all the time because they were nervous and excited about their concert .
`` Yes , but our grandpa is dead , do n't you remember ? '' - I cried .
Dear Kim
I hope that I have covered all the information you will need and look forward to seeing you .
Dear friend .
Recently , we had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives . My life has also changed as a result of modern technology . Thanks to computers , phones , mobile phones , and the Internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to before . My father is a sailor and I see him only four times a year . But thanks to mobile phones I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean . I also enjoy shopping on the Internet . This way I do n't have to be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes . In the future I would love to be a doctor , especially a cardiologist . Nowadays , modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients .
The concert went terrifically , too ! There must have been hundreds out there - dancing , laughing , shouting.. and I was having the time of my life ! I handed out refreshment to the pop group 's members during breaks - my friends were so jealous of me !
I was delighted to receive your letter and to know that a group of students from your college have decided to take part in our international student conference .
Maybe she did it to make friends . But in fact that day she had lost my friendship .
THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA - Ernest Hemingway
There was an old married couple . They had no children . One day , the lady went to a river to wash their clothes and the man went to a mountain to cut trees . In a bamboo forest , he found a shining piece of bamboo . When he cut it , he found a beautiful baby girl in it . She was named the bamboo princess .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Finally , I think that this evening was very far from being perfect , and I ask you for my money , which I spent on this horrible evening in your theatre , back .
When I received my monthly pay , I rushed down to the shop and without thinking , bought that dress . I was back to where I was before - with no money ( and a black dress ) all over again .
Eternal crowds , high prices , long hours of choosing a suitable thing , that is what shopping means to me .
Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased to hear from you about my winning the competition . I am writing to inform you of my preferences and ask a few questions about the camping .
Dear Sirs ,
Sometimes , when you shop on the street , you will see a lot of things that you like , and you ca n't buy them once , then maybe you will feel very sad . And then , you may save money for the things you like , nothing to do , just for the poor things what you like so funny , is n't it ?
However , there are a few times when you can not enjoy shopping . The first one is the Christmas period . Shops are incredibly crowded . You can not try on a dress and decide to buy it , or not in peace , because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn . In many cases , you do not even find the things you want , because the shops run out of products very quickly . Moreover , during this period , prices are usually much higher than in the other months .
Hello , how are you ? I 'm fine . Thank you for the letter . I got it today and could n't believe it ! You asked me for some further information . I will write it down .
A small percentage , on the contrary , said it would be very useful to film the teacher when she is something important to us , to give an idea of real life in our classroom . which is the most .
The boy had grown and had become very strong when he heard that there were lots of devils on Onigashima Island who robbed many people in Bizen of a lot of money and a lot of treasure . He made up his mind to defeat them , and asked his stepmother for some kibidango , one of traditional snacks in Japan . Having eaten the kibidango , he departed for Onigashima with three friends of his : a dog , a monkey and a bird .
Yours faithfully
Anyway , if you want to know about something of our country , I 'm glad to tell you more .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
And I choose photography and tennis from the activities list . I am taking photography lessons at university and I started tennis when I was 10 so I am good at both of them .
In addition , I would rather sleep in a tent since I like being close to nature and , especially , singing birds . I enjoy sports and I would like to go swimming and climbing . I am not too bad at these sports .
G. Ramos
For the time that I will spend there I would like to choose more than two activities but I know it is not possible so I choose swimming and singing . I usually sing in my spare time and my friends love it when I sing and regarding swimming I was champion last year in my city . So , I am quite good .
Yours faithfully :
Modern technology has a big influence on our life . It is easier . We can communicate with people by using mobile phones or telephones , which are the best things ever made . I use them very often in my daily life .
Secondly , the show started after a delay of 45 minutes , and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed . Another problem was the male actor who starred : the well-known and talented actor mentioned in the advertisement was replaced by another one , who was really very disappointing and after the performance , I visited the theatre restaurant , which was supposed to be open and available for meals after the show , but it was closed .
The real show is really very different to what is described in the advertisement . I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back . Please would you also change the advertisement to the level of the actual facts .
It was a great idea to do something like that . There were jazz , rock and classical concerts , but some concert halls were too small for all the people who attended that festival . There were also plays and films , dance shows , which I liked the most , art exhibitions and talks by writers , but it would be good to see more plays and films next year . Also it was a great idea to have one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events .
Secondly , you asked me when I have time for travel , so I can only go in July , because I only have holiday in July . And I would like to go in the first part of this month , the second part I spend with my family .
If you really want to discover what Greek history means , we strongly recommend you to visit the historical museum ! ! !
At the end we had 1200 in profit and each of us took 400 for himself
In my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir . and we have got three buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching I think somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you ca n't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about class rooms it very big and comfortable . For study my college is really amazing .
Pablo Fernandez
I look forward to receiving your next letter !
We want to say thanks again for your help and you must be sure that your opinion would be valuable to us .
On the other hand , there are a few famous people who desire to be watched by the media . If the media stopped focusing on these people , they would think that they have been put in a bin like rubbish . Moreover , many people love to watch a gossip programme on TV or in a magazine . It is one of fun in our life .
Thank you very much for your excellent programme ! We like it very much ! But we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show . It is on Tuesday . We think that you would also like to go there , when you know more about it . The latest fashions will be shown there . Also , we will see leisure and sports wear .
Thank you for your letter . It was great to hear from you .
I liked that especially . I do n't like to tidy up , you know ! ! I like to face people whom I do n't even know . Foremost , after finishing my work , I could meet singers by chance ! !
I have already seen other versions of this musical and Danny Brook is a bad actor , who ended with the musical .
Katerina .
During a week 's holiday I had in London , I went to see your last musical show called `` Over the rainbow '' at The Circle Theatre . I saw an advertisement which made it seem very attractive to me .
I have received your letter about the prize I have won in your competition . I would like to thank you and give some of the information you asked about me .
Yours sincerely ,
During my holidays in London I went to see your musical show .
I am looking forward to hearing from you
Grey and black - like the seasons , like people 's characters , like all the night and dark surrounding us . These are the colours of the FUTURE .

Dear Mr. Robertson :
Apart from being in fashion , it is also a very helpful machine . Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car which would n't work ? What would you have done at that moment without a mobile phone ? You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you , amazing , is n't it ?
I am looking forward to hearing from you and I insist that you refund my money at once .
I would recommend the lessons and activities mentioned above in order to make the video in question .
Computers have changed my lifestyle , my opinions about the world . And they affect everyone 's life directly or indirectly .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
The concert was on a Sunday and we had to work at the back of the stage , doing all sorts of things like collecting rubbish and helping other people who were working there . We were so close to him . I did n't have the chance to talk with him but I do n't mind . I will never forget that day . Since then , I and my sister talk about Luis Miguel every day .
I look forward to hearing from you in due course .
I was very pleased to receive your letter . It is my pleasure to help you with organising the international student conference .
After reading the whole organized programme , we all agreed about the sightseeing tour by bus around London , which will give us the knowledge of this fantastic city we have all wanted to have since a long time ago .
Here is my article .
I really enjoyed serving the drinks to the pop-stars . You could speak to them and you could see that a lot were very cool and the other ones were still in the sky . And you heard the concerts too .
Subject : a short video about daily life at school
( Rumgopol Rinsook ) .
Dear Monte ,
Yours sincerely ,
On the whole , people nowadays do care more about their appearance and will continue to do so .
Yours sincerely
What is more , about the tickets , discounts were not available as it was not said so .
Thus , the musical show was n't as good as it should have been . I was very disappointed because D. Brook and T. Truelove are such great actors and I was very excited about seeing them .
For those students who are very interested in shopping , clothes shops , jewellery , stationery , bookshops , fashion and beauty departments and many more are available . For those who want something more exciting and adventurous , you are recommended to visit the Fun Fair and amusement arcade on the top floor of the building . Other facilities such as cinemas , theatres , and large department stores can also be found there . There is a little souvenir shop for tourists and a special discount for tourists from abroad who want to use the car park .
Thank you for your recent letter . First , I would like to congratulate you on your new responsibility , because of Mr Brown 's illness .
I 'm looking forward to hearing your answer .
Yours sincerely ,
On the other hand , I have to admit that technology makes things so easy that when I have to do them without it I find it very difficult . The best example is the homework I have to do for school . I ca n't manage to do it when I do n't have my computer to help . In addition to that , technology sometimes does n't let me develop my imagination and creative skills . My mother says that I 'm always playing with my computer or watching T.V . instead of reading or doing some more interesting activities .
Mark and his family decided to go for a walk in the Alps . So , his father prepared the car and his mother took some food for the journey .
I have safely received your letter bringing the good news . I wish that I could describe how ecstatic I felt when I found out that I won the competition . Here I enclose some information which you requested in the letter I received .
I would also like to take tennis and painting activities while staying at the camp . I 've played tennis for eight years now and have competed in many matches . I take painting as my hobby as well , even though I have never taken proper lessons .
When I think about it now , shopping is not always enjoyable .
Last week , I visited your theatre and I was very disappointed because I did not have a perfect evening out like your advertisement said .
Dear Sir/Madam
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Dear Sir ,
Best wishes
17th June 2000
Hi Helen ,
Dear Manager ,
I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience .
Yours sincerely
Then , on the ticket it says that the show starts at 19.30 and , I do n't know why , it started at 20:15 , very impolite on your part , and , also , you wasted my time .
I think it would be better for me to travel in July . I will start an Italian course in August , so it will be impossible for me to leave then .
Also my kids have school holidays during this month therefore I hope to travel in mid July .
Can you imagine you and your friends going on a picnic to the Moon with a silvery skirt with astronaut boots with fire coming out at the bottom of your boots ? It could be more fascinating .
We had a class discussion about shopping , because of it I 'm writing to explain about my opinion .
I hope you will feel like me one day . I will write to you again soon and tell you how I am getting on .
What kind of clothes met it ?
I would like to travel in July because I have got my summer holidays from July to August and I work as a bank clerk in August . I think a tent would suit my personal lifestyle better than a log cabin because I love nature .
Yours faithfully ,
My friend and I had just arrived at a small airport in the middle of the Californian desert . A man came out from a small building . It was our pilot . He introduced himself and we walked towards a small plane . The doors of the plane were so thin that I thought I could have torn them . We went inside and the plane took off . It was horrible . I could feel every movement which was caused by clouds or wind . I thought we would die .

I think it was definitely not the perfect evening guaranteed in your advertisement . I look forward to having a full refund in the very near future as I did not enjoy it at all .
For the reasons I have already explained , I would like to ask you if I can have my money back , but this is not the most important thing for me , because I want your theatre to change and become the best .
Yours faithfully
Yours sincerely ,
I believe modern technology has changed everyone , especially now with computers and all the other machines . Personally , modern technology has changed me a lot . First I want to talk about the computer . Before , I used some other ways to get information or play or communicate with people . Now I can do all this with the computer . I can spend so many hours because day by day I discover new things . Maybe it is not good because you do n't have the opportunity to meet people and talk face-to-face . Apart from computers we have the telephone , TV , and gyms . All of these are in my life .

Second , I 'd prefer to have a log cabin where I could store some things .
Sometimes when we go shopping with someone who is not good company , we do n't have a great time , or when we know what we want to buy , but when we get to the store they do n't have what we want , in that instance we need to shop also when is an important day like Father 's day or Christmas everywhere we want to go and buy something it is very crowded so we ca n't find what we are looking for calmly because everybody is pushing you in the other direction to the one you want
But when the show started , they said Danny was n't there because of his illness and I felt very upset and dismayed about it because the experience I had was unlike what the advertisement promised . After the boring show finished , I was hungry and I decided to go to your theatre restaurant but the restaurant was closed after 19.00 . So what 's the point of saying 'visit our restaurant after the show ' ?
Hi ! How are you doing ? I 'm fine . As you asked me about the concert , I 'll write about it today .
Dear Sir/Madam
In the advertisement it was written that Danny Brook would be there too . ( I like him very much and , frankly , I came to the theatre just to see him )
To sum up , although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention any more , the fact that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not be changed .
For instance with the arrival of the Internet , the new digital television and the researchers in medicine , we are discovering how we can change our lives with only the press of a button , or look for something new by only thinking about it ... we realize that the new technology has just begun to advance , and it is likely in a few years we will be very advanced in this way .
Best Regards ,
Yours sincerely
If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends , or if something terrible has happened to me , I do not have to run somewhere to find a telephone box . I just use my mobile phone . Finally , I can say that modern technology really helps people in their work . With it people do their work more quickly and successfully .
Let me ask a question about clothes and money . What kind of clothes do I need and how much money do I have to take ?
Last week I was shopping with my younger brother . Awful ! He wanted everything that his eyes saw . All the stuff for children is on the same level as their eyes . Afterwards , I felt tired and unsatisfied with the store .
Hereby I have to ask for my money back or a discount for me .
I am writing this letter because we saw your programme for our next trip to London and we would like to suggest to you just one thing .
Yours sincerely
I have recently received your letter saying that I have won the first prize in the competition . It was very fortunate for me .
During my two weeks at Camp California , I 'd like to practise climbing and surfing , the basics of which I know perfectly well .
So I now need a `` perfect - refund - '' in replacement for your `` perfect evening out '' .
Yours sincerely ,
When one day Pat came over to my house , we started arguing about ordinary things and during our fight the subject of my father and his problems suddenly came up . Pat started shouting and screaming , saying what was really going on . My brother could n't stay away . He stood outside my door and heard every single word . When I realised , it was too late . The secret had been revealed . And now I try to help my brother because I 've been there , in his place , and I know how it feels .

Another thing that has changed my daily life is the mobile phone . As a matter of fact , if I am stuck in my car in traffic , I can call my boyfriend to tell him that I will be late . Once , I saw an accident and I could call the police . Sometimes the ring is annoying but , finally , the mobile phone is a great , handy object .
I also would like to know if I have to take any money and what kind of clothes are suitable for that location . Please reply me soon .
I am writing to complain about the musical 'OVER THE RAINBOW ' . There were some unfortunate incidents .
I think we should book the Palace Hotel . It is an outstanding building situated in the city centre .
I am sorry to cause you inconvenience . I hope it does n't cause any trouble if you accept my suggestion .
In conclusion , I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidentally get into a bad situation or you can not control your expenditure carefully .
Dear George ,
Yours Sincerely ,
The hotel is ten minutes away from the conference centre and there will be a bus available to go directly over there .
It is rare that schools do n't have a multimedia centre with many computers for the students to use . But this is good and bad at the same time . Good because you can have access to a lot of information , and it is bad because the computers are doing people 's work . Nowadays we have teachers , and tomorrow ? Who has the certain knowledge that computers will not take the place of teachers ? It is interesting to start to think about this point .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
Then , I did not get a discount and I had to buy a full-price ticket , although I am not an adult yet .
An argument in favour of this statement is that shopping is very tiring . You can be walking for hours and finally you ca n't find anything that you like .
Dear Kim !
I received your letter last week and was surprised to see that I had won a competition . It is the first time it has happened to me .
However , there are a lot of negative aspects to the way that technology affects my life . As technology develops so fast , there are always new things to buy , and it also reduces the amount of jobs available , so it is getting hard to find a job .
Competition Organiser
Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression . You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have , buying clothes , jewellery , furniture , etc . and you could have a really great time .
I am writing to reply to the letter you wrote to me on 10 June .
yours faithfully ,
In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisement and I would be greatful if you could give me back a part of my money .
Yours sincerely
I am writing to complain about your music show entitled `` Over the Rainbow '' , which I saw during my holiday in London .
As a conclusion I would like to ask you about the money and the clothes I must take with me . Please drop me a line
To : Mrs. Sexington
Yours sincerely ,
Yours sincerely ,
Thank you very much for your letter . I was very glad to hear that I had won first prize in the competition .
Thanks very much for your last letter . Because I could see how anxious you are to know about my experience at the Radiohead concert last month , I 'll tell you something : it was fantastic .
The secret
I am sure you can understand my disappointment . I must insist that you refund the cost of the show . Unless I hear from you within ten days , I shall have to take legal advice on this matter .
SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE .
Dear Sir , or Madam ,
I want to do these two activities while I am at the camp : sailing and photography . I have great experience of sailing . I used to work for a sailing company in Turkey . And I have a certificate in using a radio ( VHF ) . I have knowledge of navigation , engine , ropes and knots , and sails as well .
Dear Kim ,
And I would like to have a chance to do painting and photography . I am not so fit and healthy , so I do n't like to do exercise . However , drawing some beautiful scenery and taking some pictures would be a very good experience for me . I hope so very much .
To begin with , it was not Danny Book who acted in the show , as you wrote .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the musical show I saw yesterday , called 'Over The Rainbow ' .
With love
A few years ago , I did not know what the Internet was , how to use it and so on . But , while it has spread all over the world , I and all the other people who I have known started to use them .
Another disappointing thing I found was that the restaurant was closed because the cook had had an accident with hot water when he was boiling some vegetables .
Moreover it was written in the advertisement that the musical was between 14.30 and 18.30 . Surprisingly the show started at 20:15 . That destroyed all my plans . Then I decided to have dinner at your Theatre Restaurant after the show , but unfortunately it was closed .
Conclusion
I think it 's a wonderful idea and my advice is to take it if you have an offer ! I had so much fun helping my friends ' band putting on their concert .
Egyptians , Mayas , Incas , etc . had civilisations with great knowledge because they had mastered most of the fields of science we deal with today .
Shopping sounds very enjoyable and is fantastic for women . You can find a lot of interesting things which were unexpected . Some people enjoy window shopping , but some people enjoy spending their money on clothes or shoes . Nowadays , in a family , shopping is n't a woman 's job .
I would be really grateful if you could send me some information or any relevant brochure .
AFTER THE SHOW I GOT OUT OF THE SHOW ROOM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED AND WENT TO THE RESTAURANT TO DRINK SOMETHING TO RELAX , AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ? .. IT WAS CLOSED ! I COULD N'T BELIEVE IT . HOW CAN THIS CLASS OF THEATRE BE SO .. OH I 'M GETING MAD AGAIN SO I AM GOING TO TELL YOU ONE LAST THING , IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE NIGHT I HAD EVER HAD SO I DEMAND MY MONEY BACK !
We will have a great party at the end of the conference . The party will be formal , therefore you will have to wear formal clothes like a suit or a dress . As you know , it is not suitable to wear jeans or something similar .
Because of my business , I am very busy and this is the best time for my business so I ca n't organise any time to go on holiday , but I 'd be able to travel at anytime in July . I would prefer to stay in a tent as I feel that it would be more exciting than staying in a log cabin . As you offered me two activities , I would like to go swimming . I am not a good swimmer yet but soon I will be . I have been learning to swim for the last eight months and I have been really enjoying it . Another sport I have played is Basketball , which I used to play for the school 's team when I was at secondary school . I have not been playing it at all recently but only wish I had . This trip will certainly be a good opportunity for me to start playing it again .
I would like to change the rule about not speaking in Spanish at school because most of us feel more comfortable speaking in Spanish , but I guess , to learn , we should speak English all the time .
First of all I would like to thank you for your generous award . I have been dreaming of a holiday for such a long time . Now I have the opportunity so I shall inform you fully .
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like nature very much , and camping , so I think that I will be better in a tent than in a log cabin .
Anyway , it was a great experience and I enjoyed it very much . The part I enjoyed most was the one when they paid me . It was n't much but that means nothing when you have the chance to take part in an event like that . They also gave me a ticket to watch the concert live . Great show .
The next day , I decided that I did n't want to go to school any more . I was afraid that everybody would comment on my first lesson . I wish I had n't told Pat about my plans . Eventually , things were n't so bad . I went to school and everyone was very friendly . Pat apologized to me for not keeping my secrets . At the beginning I was very angry but in the end I said that everything was O.K .
The princess grew up to be beautiful . Some princes proposed to her . But she said to them , `` If you want me , you have to do this , '' and asked them to do impossible things because she did n't want to get married . One day , the old couple saw the princess crying . When they asked her about this , she said , `` I am from the moon and I will have to go back soon '' . They really loved her and they asked a prince who loved the princess to protect her . But , one day , the princess went back to the moon with guards from the moon although the prince and his army tried hard to protect her .
I 'm so happy that I 've won 2 weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. At first I could n't believe that I was a winner
16.12.00
Anyway , there are some questions I 'd like to ask you : what kind of clothes would be the most suitable for California weather in summer , and how much money do you think I 'll need ?
I will be pleased to swim and paint when I am at the camp . I selected swimming because it is a cure for my backache and I have not done it since I started my new job five years ago . I also chose painting because I have never done it before . I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a relaxing activity .
Yours faithfully ,
With reference to the letter from you , I would like to inform you of some further information , as follows .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Secondly , the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 as mentioned in the advertisement .
Due to my huge dissatisfaction , I would like my money back , as you do not provide what was advertised .
Yours sincerely ,
In your letter you ask me to choose which type of accommodation I prefer . I would like very much to stay in a tent . Last year I stayed in a tent with some friends in England and I really enjoyed it . In summertime the weather is good and I do n't see there being any problem with anywhere I stay .
Yours sincerely
Moreover , as your advertisement , we would get a discount price for the ticket , but it was not available .
yours faithfully
Yu Phu Tung .
The conference will last one hour , and , at 8 o'clock the party will start . It is a formal party and you should wear formal clothes . The dress code is no jeans . We will provide you with food and drinks .
I am writing to complain about the musical , OVER THE RAINBOW , and also about the service .
I am writing to complain about your musical show `` Over the Rainbow '' . Last week I was on holiday in London and I was very disappointed when I visited your theatre .
Imagine your life without a telephone . Yes , I know , it is very hard to imagine our lives without this invention .
Or do they want to be persecuted by the media ?
First of all , the reason why I bought the ticket was Danny Brook , who is my favourite star , and was going to appear in the show . However , there was a different actor instead of him , and this was most my disappointment .
Yours faithfully ,
Moreover , when I went to buy the tickets no discounts were available .
You 'd like to know how the Top-Pop Concert was , which I helped to organise last month . It was absolutely great ! I was responsible for the security of one of the sectors . I gave information about correct ways to other places like toilets and medical points . I was also asked about the timetable of the concert and I looked for drugs , knives and so on in bags . Although I worked I watched the concert . It was great fun ! People danced , screamed and sang with the singer . I looked very carefully at the organisation of the event , you know I 'm interested in it .
I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not jeans . Synthetic materials have developed and become very popular so they would keep going . But maybe the shape of the clothes will change : large `` baggy '' pants , or trousers with many pockets as we see today . For women , clothes change more than for men . It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of dressing . I guess they will wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt , or more masculine clothes because they want to change . Finally it 's very difficult to say what .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I would prefer to be put up in a tent because I love camping but also I do n't mind the second possibility .
About a millennium ago everything was different ; people did n't have electricity , they cooked their food on the fire and they did n't have pens .
Yours sincerely
Finally , I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably priced ticket for the weekend is excellent . We can go where we want to , see what we feel like seeing . However , I think the weekend is really too short . May I suggest you think about doing the festival over a week .
Yours sincerely ,
I really enjoy swimming and playing tennis . Unfortunately I am not good at either of them . Maybe I will have time to do enough practice , as much as I always wanted to do .
Another disadvantage of the festival 's programme was the lack of plays and films which are the best to display a modern country 's culture , I think . I hope there will be more of them next year .
Sometimes it is n't so easy to find what you need . For example : you have in your memory a great pair of shoes that you saw last week in a shop . Now you want to buy it but it 's nowhere to be found ! That 's a pity !
On the other hand , life will be boring , a large amount of workers will be redundant and housewives will not have anything to do , which will be extremely boring and tedious .
Dear Kim ,
And now about my home .
As I was spending a weekend in London . I took the opportunity to see the performance of one of my favourite actors , Danny Brook . Unfortunately as soon as I got to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore . Besides , since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we had n't had any dinner , as we had been thinking of having it at your restaurant . You can not imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been postponed to 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of repair work ; as a matter of fact , after the show we only ate a hamburger in a fast-food restaurant .
On the other hand , shopping can be unenjoyable .
I was very disappointed with my supposed `` perfect evening out '' at your theatre and for all the above-mentioned reasons I am asking for a complete refund on the two attached tickets .
Nevertheless , the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage , which is terribly crowded . You can not make a step without `` touching '' others . It gets enormously unbearable on hot summer days , when the temperature increases . In such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring . But the worst moment comes if you can not find the thing you were looking for , because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out .
Well , I hope you wo n't be as lazy as me and you 'll write soon .
There are many different people 's inventions around us . We are so used to them that sometimes we think they always existed . Some of them are very practical , others are rather strange .

The plays and the films were really great . I enjoyed all of them . I hope to see many more films next year .
Dear Jane Clark ,
One day as I was talking with my teacher about the project I saw what could be the final answer sheet to the exam on the top of his desk . Suddenly , when the teacher went out of his office , I quickly copied the answers into my notebook . I could n't believe it . This would be the easiest exam I would do . As I went out of the office I found Pat , my best friend , walking down the corridor . As she was also doing the project I decided to let her copy the answers . I told her she must n't talk about it to anybody . She agreed and went home very happy . When night came I could n't believe what was happening . Almost all my classmates were at the front door of my house asking me if I had the answers to the exam . I could n't believe that my best friend had told everybody about my secret .
You want some further information from me . About the date when I want to travel , can I say that it is only possible for me in July because I have to do some exams at school . Regarding the accommodation at the camp , I would prefer a tent . The reason is that I like to live really naturally and it is more enjoyable to live in a tent than in a cabin .
Yours sincerely ,
I was exhausted when the concert finished . Anyway it has been one of my best experiences and I 'll remember it for ever .
I had to search the Internet for pictures that could be used for the flier . We booked the accommodation for the group . I was responsible for checking the light and sound . In addition I checked the e-mail daily and answered the phone . As you know , I sold tickets in some schools and pubs , too .
We would like to ask you whether we can change some of the programme . Our suggestion is that we can go shopping on Wednesday 15 March so on Tuesday afternoon we can go to The London Fashion and Leisure Show . We wo n't miss any event that you have planned and we could also have a great opportunity to see the show .
Why do n't you buy the green one ? Oh , no ! That 's horrible , mum ! This is a normal scene when a mother and her daughter are shopping and getting clothes from the shelves . That is what most women love . They love going to a shopping centre and putting lots of clothes on . That 's so good when you have the money to enjoy it but , apart from that , there are many problems .
Yours sincerely
I am also pleased to have the chance to do some activities and I would like to choose something I am not able to do . So , I have decided to choose photography and surfing because I am an absolute beginner at both of them .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,

I write this letter to you to describe the very bad evening I have had in your theatre . In the paper it was written that the principal actor is `` Danny Brook '' but it was n't him , it was a different actor whom we had never seen , or heard . I think it 's really not right .
Thank you in advance for your understanding and we look forward to hearing from you .

Shopping is not always enjoyable
16 , Dec. 2000
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT ... BECAUSE
I think modern techonology has changed my daily life a lot and I hope it will develop even more to change my life even more .
In our opinion , we should go to the show . Firstly , because we are keen on fashion . Secondly , because we do not have to pay for the tickets .
Dear Andy :
In short , the Amusement Centre is a fascinating place and it deserves a visit . I would highly recommend this building , because you can not only enjoy yourself but also experience Korean culture which might be exotic to foreign visitors .
When I started work , I wrote everything I did on sheets of paper and if sometimes I made mistakes , I had to cross them out and it was n't very well done . I had to work out all my figures two times to make sure that my accounts were accurate .
All of her fans were stood up the whole concert and dancing . I was so exciting night .
Thank you for your letter . It was so nice to hear from you again and I am glad you have mentioned this subject .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I would like to do Tennis and Photography . I am in the tennis team at school and I have played against various other schools before . I also enjoy photography . I am doing this subject for my G.C.S.E.s so it would be very helpful for me to practise .
Finally , I have two questions more : I wonder if I can change my French money in the camp and what kind of clothes I have to buy before coming ?
Thank you very much for your programme , but we have another plan - to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which unfortunately is on the same day as the day we would visit the Science Museum . So we would like you to change the plan a little . Your programme is very good , especially as we can go to visit the Science Museum , which I heard is very good , but a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a good opportunity for us to see the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make-up and hairstyles and it is free for students too . So we think we should change your programme by going to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon and doing the shopping after the show .
Yours sincerely
Yours Sincerely
I would be grateful if you would give me more information .
Technology is the thing that makes our life easy . Technology is in every part of our life .
First of all you said that the star would be Danny Brook but it was not . Another actor took his place .
16.12.00
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students , I strongly recommend it for their excursion and because of their interests .
Secondly I think we will be mixing clothes from all over the world , because we are travelling around more and more . And that is nice if you can pick up the best things from all over the world , but on the other hand it is not so nice if every nationality wears the same type of clothes .
In addition , it was nine days of hard work to mount all the different spot and hundreds of Coblights in the right place .
Sara was a very good pupil . She did n't study a lot but she knew all the important things . She was a very nice person and she always helped if somebody needed her help .

I am very happy to hear that I 've won first prize in your competition . Below I provide you with the information that you asked me for . I would like to travel in July . I already have plans for my holiday and July suits me the best . As for accommodation , I would prefer log cabins , because I believe they are more comfortable than tents .
The event is a great opportunity because it is on the 14th of March and it is free for students . For practical information , this show starts at 10.00 and closes at 19.00 . It will be in the Central Exhibition Hall in London . It is not too far and the opening hours suit us .
I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely disappointed by the show . I got to the theatre at 18:30 because I wanted to have a drink before I went to the hall so I got there earlier . The show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 . It was about fourty five minutes later than the original starting time . I was just a bit upset but I was n't that upset at that time . The thing which made me really upset was the actor . The actor should have been Danny Brook but it was another man who I have n't seen before . I liked Danny Brook so much and I was expecting to see him but you did n't even mention that that actor was going to be changed to another man . This thing should n't have happened .
Love ,

Because of all this trouble I think we should have our money back . We both had £15 tickets . And next time , make sure that your advertisement is accurate !
I received your letter . I do not want to keep you curious any longer . The opportunity of being able to help in the concert knocked on my door by chance . I heard they were looking for volunteers to help at the pop concert . I , of course , jumped at it . The idea of meeting a pop singer known worldwide just made my heart punch my ribcage . The concert was already filled up with thousands of , although it was really early . We , the volunteers , first unravelled the cables , and set up the microphones and some instruments . Then we were told go backstage and make sure everything was perfect . After a fantastic concert , I actually had the chance to meet Britney Spears . She is a very nice person . I managed to scavenge an autograph for you as well , I will put it in the envelope .
Finally , may I ask for some more information ? What kinds of clothes should I take ? . How about the weather there ? Will you give me some pocket-money during the trip ? Also , may I take a friend with me ? How much should she pay ?
A wonderful example of modern technology : the computer ! It is not a living thing but it has a brain . It knows more than most people .
I would like to know if I need any special clothes , extra money or any other things . Could you please send me more details about that ?
Anyway , by the time we finished everything , thousands of fans came into this concert hall . Everybody looked very excited about the concert .
I am especially glad about the activities offered , in particular the sports facilities because I specialised in sport for my A-levels and intend to become a sports teacher .
I had never wanted to be a hero
I started to have a lot of new friends , they all wanted to be my best friend .

Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend , that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on , you have to bear the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien on their territory .
I hope you will find all the details which you would like to have in the letter . If you need any more information , please let me know .
Every woman in the world likes the word shopping . It is as if they lose their conscience while they are shopping .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I should n't have told her that my dad had psychological problems . I knew that she was going to spread it around and tell my brother .
'Shopping ' means buying goods for your daily requirements , e.g . food , clothes . We do not speak here about luxury goods .
To be honest , the next greatest invention of mankind , the computer , ca n't work if you have n't got the phone . So I am very grateful to the man who invented it . Unfortunately , I have forgotten his name . It always happens with people , does n't it ? Try asking who invented the wheel or the book .
Finally , I was planning to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because a machine was broken . This was very disappointing .
Shopping is Not Enjoyable Anymore
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
In the future it is possible that you wo n't have to prepare your breakfast yourself , perhaps you will just have to press a button when your alarm clock has gone off . In addition to this , you may have some robots bringing the newspaper to the table , tidying up the house , and doing the shopping . Maybe they will also be your life partners .
Yours faithfully
I am Margherita X from class 3C , who are going to spend three days in London . We had the opportunity to read your programme and we are happy because it is very well organized . We especially like the idea of going to the National Art gallery . Thank you .
Maybe , it is a good way to get an audience but I 'm going to tell my travel agent .
Well I have to go now . Hope to hear from you later .
Dear Mrs Ryan
It was a great idea to organize such a festival . I am a teacher and I love music . Most of the events which I saw were good . I enjoyed the dance shows , and the jazz and rock concerts . I visited art exhibitions . There were a lot of nice pictures , sculptures and other creative works . I was impressed by them . At the festival I could talk with writers . It was an excellent idea to have one reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events . A lot of people could visit as many events as they wanted .
But the invention that I 'm most thankful for is the computer and the Internet ! Thanks to them , I can easily communicate with my family and friends at home when I 'm here in England . It 's so quick and not too expensive either . To use the mobile phone , by the way , is very expensive . I usually use it for sending SMS Messages to my friends .
Dear Kim ,
I am very disappointed with this evening and with this disorganised way of dealing with problems so I am asking for my money back .
To conclude , I was very happy to have a ticket for all events at a reasonable price , because for someone who does not especially like art , it was very attractive .
Yours faithfully ,
From : Meng
I know you will understand my frustration and that 's why I would like a total refund of my money or at least another ticket that goes with my wishes .
Give my best wishes to your family .
King Regards
Thirdly , the only restaurant in your theatre was closed because of renovations .
The student
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
First of all , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 , but it was delayed until 20.15 , and when the show finally began we were surprised to see that Danny Brook , who was the star of the show , was not playing and someone else had replaced him and he was really disappointing .
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED , BECAUSE THAT EVENING OUT WAS NOT AS PERFECT AS I HAD PLANNED .
Once again , thanks .
Best wishes ,
I am writing to you to complain about the unexpected evening I had when I went to see the musical show `` Over the rainbow '' in your theatre .
Yours sincerely
About the end-of-conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night , and a special guest , I still do n't know who , will be expected . I suggest wearing casual clothes . I think there 's no need for school uniforms .
Last weekend , I was in London with my friend and I saw your musical show `` over the Rainbow '' .
Though the Internet has a lot of positive aspects , I think you should be careful with it and not be dependent on it .
Bye for now
I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund . I expect to receive a cheque for £20 . I look forward to hearing soon .
Thanking you in advance for your help , I look forward to hearing from you .
Thank you for holding a great festival which made all the arts activities come together .
I am very disappointed , and if it is possible , I want you to return my money .
Yours faithfully ,
13 June 00
Yours sincerely
If you have any further questions , just let me know .
It was a charity concert to raise money for poor people in AFRICA .
In particular , I ca n't bear to go shopping with my mother : it takes so much time that later I regret agreeing to go with her .
Dear Sir ,
CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP , PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED . I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE OVER ALL . REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY . I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS . THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS . PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY .
The lifestyle has changed already from the past . Shopping is a common activity in their life . We must focus on the specific lifestyle , which will make us happy .
We think that it will be a great opportunity for us to see this show because we are all interested in fashion .
Thank you very much for your attention on my behalf
. I prefer to stay in log cabins rather than in tents , because log cabins have much esctructure , that I need to stay for a few days .
I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some questions , please do not hesitate to contact us .
As I 'm a student , I usually get discounts on various things , so I was so disappointed when I could n't get one there !
Our English class has an additional wish concerning the programme for our trip . We have seen an advertisement for the `` London Fashion and Leisure Show '' and we would all like to go to the show . We think it is a great opportunity because it only takes place once a year and it is free for students . We would suggest replacing the shopping trip on Tuesday afternoon with the visit to the show . We think we would all have another chance for shopping in London sometime later .
Dear John ,
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
Karol Johannes
Finally , I would like to say that my evening out two days ago was not perfect and I would be glad if you could give some of my money back .
My name is Alida Fanetti , and I 'm writing to you about the musical show which I saw during my stay in London recently .
I hope you 'll enjoy going there .
You will ask me why . The reason is given above ... '' unity '' . In addition `` the students must not use any commercial paper bags ( received at a department store etc ) '' . Now you know the reason !
Last month , I helped at a pop concert by chance . I have just worked as a normal worker but I have met so many famous singers who I always see on TV . Of course , I could listen to all their music , which was so cool . After the concert I had an opportunity to join them at the party . The best thing was that I have learned how to take care of their expensive instruments and I have sung my favourite songs with them .
I began to follow my plan . I went to Pat 's house but her brother told me that she was n't there . I offered to wait ... Her brother and I began to talk ... He 's such a nice boy . I liked him very much and I guessed he liked me too ...
Secondly , I will give you with pleasure some information about myself you need to have .
In conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too busy . Otherwise if you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood . You should avoid the peak times .
I think women , in general , are very impulsive when purchasing things . Many times we buy things that , actually , we do n't need and , sometimes you are surprised when you check the balance of your bank account and then you need to cut down on your expenses for 2 months .
I must say though , I would have to travel in July because it 's the summer holidays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friends if that is possible .

Dear Jane ,

Subject : which lessons and other activities should be filmed
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU . I HAVE SENT YOU SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF ME WITH THE BAND .
I received your letter this morning and I would like to thank you for your interest in the conference . I hope I can answer your questions .
I expect that much more varied kinds of plays and films will be on next year .
At the beginning of the last century only a few very rich people could afford a car ; it was a kind of leisure or sport to drive one . Today almost everyone owns a car and needs it for daily activities . The transport network has changed in accordance with this social evolution .
Report about which lessons and activities we should film .
Anyway , I enjoyed it very much ! It was the best experience I 've ever had in my whole life . I was trying to be with the singers all the time . It was fantastic . I wanted to touch them , as the only way to convince myself that I was with them .
13th July 2000
Yours sincerely ,
I 'll be taking an English Examination at the end of June and I think it would be a good idea if I can travel in July because it 's the only month I can spend abroad this year .
From this moment , I knew without the shadow of a doubt that my mother would know about it sooner or later . It was only a question of hours before my life would collapse . I tried to take it in my stride but I could n't . I was terrified .
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen , probably by a gypsy . I was so annoyed ! I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny ! My friends lent me some money , but it was n't more than 120 pounds . I had to buy my dress , its accessories and also clothes and souvenirs ! I could n't really do much , so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs . I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop .
These days we are living in a high-technology world . Modern technology has been advancing rapidly and it has affected me a lot . Indeed , I have to save more money to upgrade my personal computer . Computer technology keeps improving all the time and consumers like you and me definitely have to spend our money to keep our personal computer up to date and capable of working with the new computer software that requires more and more performance of computer hardware .
Yours faithfully ,
Please , when you receive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything .
Secondly I would also like to say that the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it did not start until 20.15 . Finally when it started we noticed to our surprise that it was not the right actor on stage . Very disappointing , as Danny Brook is my favourite actor . We watched the musical in sadness .
About the accommodation , I would prefer a tent because I enjoy the contact with nature as well as camping activities .
Another option is to wash your neighbour 's car . In this case you need to buy the materials you will work with , but do n't worry , soap is not very expensive .
Dear Kim ,
In summary shopping can be enjoyable or not depending on our state of health . To give examples : if we are healthy we buy clothes and Records , we enjoy ourselves ; if we are sick , or our relatives are , we buy medicines and we do not enjoy ourselves because it is an obligation .
Sorry , I 'm late I know , but now I will tell you something about my experience last month .
To sum up , modern technology is changing my work , my life , and my friends .
I would like to travel in July because I will have holidays in that month .
There are too many negative points for one evening . I am afraid that I want my money back . I hope you do not disappoint me on this point .
All in all , the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone .
Firstly , according to your advertisement , the 'Stars and artists from around the world ' came from only six countries . I felt quite disappointed as everybody knows that `` our '' world is full of different cultures . Maybe not enough were represented .
Competition Organiser
After the concert I only helped tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean . Later the band was talking to me , I could get their new album free , and some other souvenirs from the band .
To help us to live happily , scientists can easily predict the changes on earth , so that we can have time to prepare or defend ourselves from natural disasters .
I prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I am not used to narrow spaces and feel more comfortable with a place like a bedroom .
Since I am a student and not as rich as Bill Gates , I was short of money and I was very pleased to hear that there were discounts available for the tickets ; but I had to give the full price of the ticket , which I consider to be the fault of your theatre .
DENIS JIMENEZ
Looking forward to hearing from you soon .
I am writing to make a complaint about the Circle Theatre . I recently went there to see the musical show `` Over the Rainbow '' . I was very disappointed to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true .
Dear Sir ,
THE BIG MISTAKE
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Moreover , shopping is just a part of life . It 's necessary to buy something to live . We have to buy something . For example , for our jobs , special ceremonies , and so on . Even when the risk comes up with shopping .
Dear sir ,
Another period when I do n't like doing shopping is when there is a huge sale ! I always go absolutely crazy when I have to do shopping then ! You can not breathe , you can not see anything apart from a bulk of shouting women and men who want to get something cheaper !
I have a suggestion on how the programme could be changed . The shopping time could be after the show and the free time exchanged for the science museum . If we go to the show , we can do without the free time .
As requested , I have collected some information about the school . Below is a summary of the most important relevant points with some recommendations .
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I am looking forward to your reply .
The most interesting lessons for pupils are lessons in which they can do something real , concrete . For example , the engineering or physics lessons are very interesting , especially the practical work . It would be great if we showed these in our film . It might also be very interesting to watch it .
4 I had also thought in the show there was a different actor .
However , the students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which will be on 14th March between 10.00 to 19.00 at the Central Exhibition Hall , London . The show has many interesting parts such as the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make-up and Hairstyles and we are all agreed that it 's a great opportunity for us because most of us are going to study on a Fashion and Design course next term and the other students are also interested in new fashions . So we think that it will be useful for all of us .
I am sorry to say that I did not enjoy the evening at your theatre at all . I hope you can pay me the money back as compensation . I am waiting for your reply .
Dear Sir ,
I went to see Over the rainbow , Friday evening the 16/6 . The musical had been advertised as London 's newest and best musical , but all to my disappointment .
In my opinion , modern technology has changed our daily life tremendously .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
As far as accommodation is concerned , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , because tents are too hot for me .
To make matters worse , despite the fact that the second show of the day was scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. , it started at 8:15 p.m. What 's more , the theatre restaurant was closed , because the chef suddenly took a day off . On top of everything , although your advertisement told me that I would receive some discounts , there were no discounts available .
Dear Kim ,
Could you please include in your next letter some information about the amount of money and clothes we have to bring ?
If we do n't use them we suffer because of them . In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car . I really need it to escape from the pollution , mainly caused by cars and other four-wheel motor vehicles . Is n't that ironic ? To go to the countryside and be able to breathe fresh , unpolluted air , I use my car , which , in my opinion , does not help to maintain a clean atmosphere at all .
At the camp I would like to choose two activities , Painting and Singing . I love painting . At university I studied art for two years , but now I do n't have much time to paint because I work in a bank and I have a baby . So I will be very happy to improve my art at the camp . The reason for my choice of singing is that I feel embarrassed about my voice , so maybe I could improve it .
Ring T Lun
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
In my opinion people need a telephone . For example a telephone is very important in professional life . Nowadays , there are no companies which do not have a telephone . Also it is good for people 's safety . You can call the police if you are in danger or the ambulance if you are injured .
17th JUNE 2000 .
Dear Kim ,
If the weather is hot then we do n't have to wear underwear because very thin and light clothes will support our bodies . There will be two functions for summer clothes that we do n't need to wear clothes like layer and layer . For example , T-shirts for women will include a bra : easy to take it out when you wash it , and it is very simple and comfortable . What about short pants ? You do n't have to wear knickers . We can just put some thin pads in there . We ca n't feel it and easy to remove and just wash it . Simplest is the best in summer !
The advertisement says 'your perfect evening out ' . However , it was the worst evening I have had in London . I would like you to give me my money back .
The aim of this report is to give some suggestions to a group of American students who have just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit .
Yours sincerely
I look forward to hearing from you .
And if this were not enough , I got no discount on the ticket such as was advertised . Besides this , we were invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show , but it was closed because it was being redecorated . So why did you make this invitation ?
Yours sincerely ,
The show should have started at 19.30 , but it did n't start until 20.15 ! So , because of that , I missed my last bus home !
I visited your theatre and I was very disappointed for a number of reasons .
Firstly , I 'd like to travel in July because I 've already registered on another summer course which starts at the end of July . Sorry about that but I can make that trip only in July .
First , I 'd like to travel in July because my friend , who is French , is coming to Toronto in August . Therefore , I 'd like to show her around and spend time with her as much as possible .
I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disappointing experience I have ever had . So because of this horrible evening I want to ask for my money back .
It was really a reasonably priced weekend for me , but you should also introduce new activities like competitions in singing songs or drawing a portrait next year . Then it would be excellent .
Yours faithfully
In addition , the theatre restaurant was closed for unknown reasons .
Austria , 13th June 200
BRASILIA ( DF ) , JUNE 17th 2000
When I arrived there , the staff were already busy . At first I just helped setting up the stage ; setting microphones , and tuning guitars . When I was doing it , one of the staff called me and took me to a room . He explained to me that it was to control the light . It was fun practising how to move the lights and change the lights . However , when it came to the real concert , it was very hard .

I think more and more people will have at least one flat ; it wo n't matter if you are rich or not . The rooms will be designed in a futuristic fashion , where there will be less furniture and everything will be compact . Even TV-sets will be on the ceiling . The rooms will be much bigger and wider than now , and you will have up to twenty rooms in your own flat , and even be able to switch on the light by saying simply : `` Light '' .
First , what kind of clothes do I need to take with me , because I do n't know anything about the weather in California , and at tend how much money will I need ?
Luna Juarez .
If you are interested in more modern buildings I suggest you visit `` Caldea '' , which is a very modern bath centre with beautiful architecture .
On the one hand , I think that some famous people are looking for media attention . Indeed , it can be useful for their career . The more they are in the media , the more famous they will be . In my opinion , some of them need to be appreciated by fans , they need to be loved and see themselves on television . However , some others only use the media to come back , because they can not find a job anymore . They need to be famous again . Besides , I think that some stars sometimes call journalists to tell them where they will be , in order to have free publicity . Moreover , in my opinion , it is also a good way for them to earn money . Famous people are so often asked to give interviews , either in the newspapers or on television , that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it .
Lots of love ,
You have also written in your advertisement that it would start at half past seven but it started at 20:15 ! So we had to wait more than a half hour . I would n't have minded if the restaurant had pressed in order to eat or drink something , but it was closed , and also it did n't open after the show , because the waitress had to clean the theatre .
I still often forget my birthday , but I will never forget that special one I had two years ago .
Next , I would like to find out some details about the camp . I need to know if my travel will take place in August . If I had known that I would win , I would not have arranged my English course in Britain . Before . The next point is the accommodation . You mentioned that it will be in tents or log cabins . I would prefer staying in tents . I am very close to nature , so it will be a pleasure for me .
Looking forward to seeing you ,
After the show , which was n't really the best I have ever seen , my family and I wanted to get some snacks in the theatre restaurant . When we arrived at the restaurant we realised that it was closed because the cook was ill. After this last point of troubles we went home with only bad memories of this evening .
I think technology has changed my life and the way of life of almost everyone around the world .
Yours faithfully
Sincerely yours ,
I find shopping is very time consuming . If I want to buy a nice pair of shoes , I have to go into a city centre and browse around from shop to shop until I find the shoes I like . If I 'm not lucky enough to find them , then I have to take a train to a larger shopping place such as London .
Marlene Berg
On the other hand , we should be interested in the other activities such as sports , which could appeal to more students in our school . For example , our basketball team has won a local championship .
I would appreciate it if you sent me a reply to my Questions as soon as possible
But I think there will not be many changes concerning the furnishing of the future homes . All the big and small things which define people 's personal environment will be left nearly unchanged - the furniture , the pictures on the wall ... .
Dear Sandro ,
Dear Helen Ryan
I am not satisfied with this musical show at all .
receive a letter from you , because I know that you are busy , but please look at my suggestion for next year 's festival .
I will contact you , if I have more questions .
Pat and Jim 's wife lived with the guilt all their long lives . How could they forget it ?
Now at the age of seventeen I made the huge mistake of mentioning this problem to my `` friend '' Pat . I knew that she was close to my brother and that she loved him a lot , so I never thought that things would turn out like this .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
Two sisters , Alex and Daniela , were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking about what they could do . That year , the winter in France was very cold . It was near Christmas and the two girls had n't found a present for their mother . Giving Christmas presents was a tradition not to be forgotten and there were only four days left . Alex suggested that it would be a good idea to go to the city to buy that present . Daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk in this kind of weather . Anyway , Alex was too stubborn to give up and it was like talking to a brick wall : she did n't listen to her sister .
Kowloon , Hong Kong

Yours Faithfully
I have been asked by my classmates to write to you to suggest a new activity which you could include in the London programme if you like it .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
Anyway , do n't you think that , nowadays , fashionable clothes are quite similar to what they were 20 years ago ? It 's evident that whatever we wear looks like clothes , and I think we should stop being so stupid . We ca n't wear peculiar clothes like in science fiction films . I bet you that in 100 years , humans will be wearing exactly the same clothes as today , because we love the actually fashion of clothes , which is wonderful . The last survey about fashion showed that people feel really comfortable with those now !
I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING YOUR PROMPT REPLY .
The telephone is a very important invention , which has affected our lives . It is a way for people to communicate although they are in two different places . People use the telephone every day and it is one of the most important things in daily life .
. If I have to take lots of clothes or is there a service to wash them .
As I jumped off the train , I met a friend of mine . I immediately wanted to show him what I had bought to make him jealous . I took the white plastic bag and ... Oh my god ! There was no more plastic bag . I had left it on the train !
To begin with , we enjoy reading gossip about famous stars and politicians , although they sometimes are n't true . In addition we are fascinated by their marriages , children , holidays etc . What is more it was their own choice to become popular and well known . When choosing this style of life they should realise what their life would be like .
About the accommodation , I have no problems , but I would prefer staying in a tent , so that the holiday may be more adventurous .
When you spend money on goods and services , it gives you satisfaction and happiness but going shopping is not always enjoyable . There are a few reasons .
Well , danger is in my nature and Life is nothing but an adventure .
The level of carbon dioxide is growing very fast and people cut down more trees , therefore there are not enough trees to absorb the carbon dioxide and produce oxygen .
Dear Mr. Robertson ,
You must understand that you promised me I 'd have a good evening and I really did n't .
A friend of mine was organising the pop concert , and as he knew me well , he asked me if I 'd like to design the clothes the pop singers would wear in the show . Of course , I accepted immediately , very pleased .
Write back soon
Yours faithfully .
Finally , from my point of view , I would like to get back the money that I paid because the show was not what you promised in the advertisement .
On the other hand , other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment . They claim that it is absolutely an intrusion on their privacy . What is more , they insist that as well as celebrities , they are also human beings who want to live without being disturbed and watched .
Endless imagination and development of technology will lead us to future fashion .
After the show many people wanted go to your theatre restaurant , but it was closed because someone has fixed something there .
I 'm sorry I can only write now because last week I had too much work .
I would like to travel in July ; that is for me the only possibility because I will finish my course at university at the end of June and I will start to work in September .
Technology is very important in our life . Mainly , because it makes it easier and more comfortable . Nevertheless , it has some advantages and drawbacks .
I can hardly wait for your reply !
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Yours faithfully
Finally I would like to ask you about I have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the weather is over there in July because I will pack the clothes as useful .
Later somebody told me that I had to look at the labels on the top .
How much effort and time it took about two decades ago to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges ! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat , and modern coffee machines can even make a cappuccino or whatever you want on their own . Those devices have made our life easier as old fridges had to be defrosted and new fridges use a different kind of cooling system and will tell you if you have forgotten to close the door ! The modern cooker will turn itself off if something goes wrong ! Personally , my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to the devices modern technology offers us .
The concert was absolutely marvellous ! So many happy people in the crowds , that the atmosphere was infectious . Anyway , what you wanted to know was what my job was . Actually my job was not really stressful , but I had contact with and access to all the famous pop stars . I had to bring them refreshments . That has been my dream since my childhood .
STUDENTS SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT 'S HAPPENING IN THEIR LIVES , SHOULD N'T THEY ?
The activities are quite hard to choose really , because you have a lot of choices which I like . But I think I will choose Basketball and Photography , because basketball is the only sport I can play well . Photography is a very interesting activity , and is not too hard to do either .
But including only six countries in the festival does not seem enough , in my opinion . I think next year you should invite more countries , because the festival would be more multicultural .
Have you ever asked yourself which lessons or activities should be filmed in the school video ? Well , I 've just polled some students and here are their responses .
Dear Miss Helen Ryan
I look forward to receiving your confirmation .
Yours faithfully ,
The performer , Paul , is a big name at the present . But I 'd never seen him before . This time , I saw him in person . I told him I loved his songs . He was very happy . Then , we had a lovely conversation . Afterwards , he gave me his pen for my enthusiasm .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
Wait for a sunny day , take a look at your wardrobe , some money , ask a friend to go with you , and enjoy an exciting shopping trip !
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . He has a best friend , who was more like a brother to him . They always did things together , and they were the most popular boys in school . Both were very handsome , played football ; they were an example for everybody . That was before the day when Pat discovered that his brother was gay . After that their relationship changed . Pat was very frightened by this situation .
Now we should be able to answer the introducing question . No , I do n't think so . Television has become so important for us that we ca n't imagine that it could n't exist .
Firstly , I would like to travel in July only because I have two months ' holiday which are July and August . I choose July because it is the only month that I think I 'm free . In August I have to work .
The thing is we are too fashion conscious , too fussy about our appearance and we 'll end up buying smart clothes only because the people next door are doing so ! !
Last week my family and I had a holiday in London . At the end of the holiday we decided to go to the theatre . I insisted on going to your theatre , to the Circle Theatre , because I have heard that it is one of the best theatres in London . That day you were showing , ,The over the Rainbow '' . As you have written in the advertisement : it is London 's newest and best musical show . But my family and I had a very disappointing evening . This was because , firstly , in it said in the advertisement that this music show would star Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but it was n't so . Danny Brook did n't act in the performance , there was another , unknown , actor . And he acted awfully , I could n't hear him . Then in the advertisement it said that the performance began at 19.30 . My family and I came at that time and had to wait till 20:15 , because the show started only at that time . I was very nervous . What is more , you wrote that discounts were available , but that was also a lie . After the show I was very disappointed , because I spent a lot of money for nothing and my husband decided to make me a pleasure . He suggested having supper in your theatre restaurant . But when we got to it , we saw that the restaurant was closed , because it was being reconstructed . But why do you mention about the restaurant in the advertisement , if it is closed ? So this evening was terrible . It spoilt all my impression of London . And now I request my money back , because I did n't get anything that was mentioned in the advertisement .
Thank you for your letter . I am very glad I won the competition . This trip will , undoubtedly , be a wonderful experience .
I suggest filming our English lessons and Maths lessons . From the activities I suggest filming sports lessons and music lessons . We have very interesting English lessons . They are always funny and nice . We always learn something new . At some lessons students are always working , but as we work , we joke , discuss many topics , tell some stories about our life . Students think that we do n't do anything and we do n't learn anything special . It 's not true . We practise our English and I think we have to film our English lessons , so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way they do . Also Maths lessons are so interesting . Many people do n't like Maths because they think that it 's a boring subject . I think it all depends on the teacher . Our Maths teacher knows how to teach so we do n't get tired of his lessons . I think we should film the Maths lessons , so students and some teachers will change their opinion about Maths . For activities , we should film sports lessons because we always do something new . We have many competitions with other schools , and we always have fun . Our music lessons are special . We try to play many instruments , and sing even if we do n't know how . And it 's always interesting to watch others while they do something like that .
M. S .
As well as all the treasures , statues and historical paintings ... there are also restaurants and modern galleries . When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat , or if you are fed up with historical things , you might as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern .
Yours faithfully ,
I 'm really happy to hear from you ! I 've had so much work at school recently ( exams ! ) and so many things to do , that I 've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit . Fortunately , the people from my class are really great and we all love trips - especially interesting ones .
The basic story of the book is in fact quite simple . It is about a tough old fisherman from Cuba who sails out alone in a small boat to fish . He is only looking for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccessful for 86 days . This day he is lucky . He gets a big swordfish hooked and after a long fight the fish is finally caught .
It is one of the most popular subjects in the school . Also , because this video is their project , it should be filmed .
As you know , the conference will start at 11:00 and it will finish at 13:00 , but we will have lunch altogether at 13:30 in the college 's hall until 14:30 .
Modern technology is , nowadays , not only a `` tool '' for everyday life but also a lifestyle . People are getting more and more addicted to this , because it helps to make everyday life easier and more comfortable .
Dear Kim ,
At the end of the conference , we will have a party . The party is to let all the students get to know each other better . The party will be in the dance hall next to the conference room . I would suggest they wear formal clothing , such as tie , trousers and blazer .
How has modern technology changed our daily lives ?
Under the circumstances , I was asked by the class to inform you about the show and to ask if it would be possible to make some changes to the programme if it could to visit the exhibition . It will take place on Tuesday from 10.00am to 7.00pm , so we could give up shopping and go to the show in the afternoon .
Firstly , I am able to travel only in July because I will be on holiday in July , furthermore I have an important exam in November . Secondly I would prefer to stay in a tent as it will be natural life while I am at the Camp . Thirdly I am keen on playing tennis and taking some photographs .
Suitable lessons and activities
I mean , it 's still unbelievable . Can you imagine how like a dream it was to be shaking their hands .
- Danny brook did not appear and I wanted to see him .
I agree with this statement .
I hope you will consider my opinions and that my suggestions will be helpful for next year .
Best regards ,
- I am very sorry but we do not have 38 .
Yours faithfully ,
I know that everyone is excited about what happened at Michael Douglas ' wedding or what kind of life the President of the United States is living but sometimes it 's going a bit too far .
So , my temporary job was sound engineer but I was not main engineer . I 've just helped the staff . When I was a university student , I studied sound effects , but I had n't used effect equipment my whole life because our school does n't have it . I used this equipment during the concert , but I was so complicated system . At first , I could n't understand this system but our staff were very kind people . They taught me specially . After that , I was able to understand this system , time after time . Now , I am able to use a sound effect system .
Dear Helen Ryan , the competition Organiser ,
'It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it '
Your group will stay at the Palace Hotel . The Palace Hotel is situated in the town centre next to the railway station . A free shuttle bus takes you to the conference centre . The bus leaves at 8 a.m. from the front entrance of the hotel .
I wanted to thank you for allowing us to have this great opportunity to visit London .
But the unexpected thing was that I actually got to meet Maddy , and talk to her for almost one hour ! The Material girl 's the sweetest person in the world , totally unlike what the media says about her . Mo ' told me everything about her new album , `` Music '' , and how the single of the same name had slipped onto the Internet in the UP3 format . She sang to me part of the album 's second single , `` How it feels like for a girl '' !
Now let 's start with shopping at the Beverley Centre . The Beverley Centre area is the place that the teenagers like to go shopping at the most . But some teenagers like to go to Bolton Market . Because everyone has different thinking like Beverley Centre if you go there every day or every week for shopping you will get very bored because sometimes there are too many people everywhere , like in the restaurants and shops . It makes you feel you want to go home . And about the traffic , sometimes it makes you feel you do n't want to go out because of the traffic . And if you never know money or you have less money shopping is not enjoyable for you I am sure . And shopping in the market is one thing that I am not going to do , because all the smells in the market are awful - there is the smell of the meat and dirty water , black and smelly water , all over the market street . I think of it it 's make my shopping enjoyable . And that 's why sometimes shopping is enjoyable , because of the place and people .
Thank you for your attention . I am looking forward to hearing from you .
I am very glad to hear from you that I have won the first prize in your competition . I would like to reply and ask you some questions .
Finally , I am going to write about the theatre , the Circle Theatre . The show was supposed to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 . Because of that , we missed the train and we had to stay one more night in London . It was your fault . We would like you to return the price of the ticket and pay us for that hotel as well . I would recommend you show that the restaurant is closed on Monday . I could not have dinner .
Listen to the radio if you want to know how it ends .
A veteran fisherman takes his boat and goes fishing to convince himself and other men that he is still able to do it . Then , Hemingway paints a marvellous description of fishing and of the great fight between the fish and the old man . The 24-hour fight is described in such a peaceful , faithful way that it callas a though about life and death . I recommend this book as a way to discover both Hemingway and American literature .
According to your advertisement , Danny Brook was involved in the show , but to my disappointment there was a different actor . To make things worse , the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 . Also , there was a problem with tickets . According to the advertisement , discounts were available , but in reality that was n't so ! On top of everything , when I decided to visit your theatre restaurant after the show , it turned out to be closed . When I insisted on an explanation , I was told that the chief cook was on holiday !
The end-of-conference party is going to start from Seven o'clock . One of our teachers , who will be elected by students will make a speech for one hour . After , a student will make a speech about what he or she has learned , and dinner . In my opinion , you should wear normal clothes . I would like to suggest that you should visit building sixty two which is on the sixty second floor . There are eye-max cinema , museums , a gallery . This is very famous in our city .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
How has modern technology changed our daily life ? Of course , our life will be completely changed . However , we have to consider our nature and human being .
Yours sincerely
On the other hand there are some disadvantages . For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with a virtual world which computers create . Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people 's labour , which leads to increasing unemployment .
Morning Lessons : Although there are a lot of classes , there is a special FCE class in which students are being prepared for the FCE exam . There are special methods and materials for students .
Pat , to win her new classmates ' friendship , told everything that she knew about her friends and , because of what Pat said , her friends ended their friendship with Pat because their popularity was damaged .
YOURS SINCERELY .
In my opinion technology has made living easier , more fun and more comfortable .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
I arrived in Paris on New Year 's Eve 2000 without a place to stay , not speaking any French , alone and with a small amount of money . But in spite of all of these disadvantages , I was pursuing my dreams and objectives and in spite of everything I was going to do it .
The list of activities that you have is very interesting so my choice was very difficult to make but I have finally decided to choose sailing because I have been sailing for five years now and enjoy it very much . My second choice is climbing because I have never climbed and would like to have a go at it .
Some people came to help him , and then realised that it was not true . They were angry . He did it some more times , and in the end nobody took any notice of the shouts .
Furthermore , no discounts were available , even though we had a student card . In the advertisement they said that ticket discounts were available . I think it is a bombastic . Anyway I was so unhappy . It was not a marvellous evening . Could you return my money please ? You have a responsibility to the audiences .
First I would like to say that making a video about daily life at our school is a great idea . Some people may think that school is boring and nothing interesting ever happens there . I hope that after seeing this video most people will change their view on that topic . To make that happen , we have to find some interesting activities to film .
Dear Madam ,
I understand from your letter that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for me , including transport to and from the airport .
( Your English class N3c )
If you need more information , please do not hesitate to write to me .
I had a problem with my best friend once when we kept in touch through e-mail . The problem was the language . We used English but neither of us were very good at it at the time , which made us misunderstand each other . However , the problem was solved by a telephone . We are now still friends . Thanks to the invention of the telephone .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . This trait did n't allow you to tell him much about yourself . He was n't really wicked , he merely did n't understand when to keep his mouth shut , especially at school where every little unimportant thing about your so-called `` private life '' runs three laps around the schoolyard before you learn it although you are the most concerned about it and did n't even know .
About accommodation , I would prefer a tent because I have never slept in a tent and I would like to try it . It will be very interesting for me because normally I do not have a lot of time to do activities . I would prefer swimming because I really like it and I am trying to swim whenever I have got some time , and painting because I have finished a painting course and I have some practice with this .
I talked to them and to many other groups that arrived later .
Dear Ms Helen :
Yours faithfully
as most people like dance shows , including me . That 's real knowledge for us , art exhibitions and talks by writers . I think we will know a writer 's life or how he is writing about it . It 's a very significant thing . Lastly , you said 'one reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events ' . It 's excellent . If you can pay attention to my small suggestion , next year I hope it will be an unbelievable festival .
`` It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it . '' Nowadays I remember those exciting days in which danger was knocking at your door every day . It was 20 years ago and we had been friends since we were 10 . In those days we decided to be friends forever and work for NASA .
`` Sagrada Familia '' , a real holy building .
Shopping is not always enjoyable
I would like to know if there is a medical staff present during the two weeks . Does any medication have to be declared to them ? In the event of an accident , will the transport back home be paid for ?
Secondly , the plays and movies were marvellous . However , I was disappointed by the number of them . It would be great if there were more choice next year . I would like to give you a suggestion about the size of the concert rooms . Considering the crowd , there should be more rooms . Finally , I would be interested in meeting artists from everywhere in the world not only European artists .
I would be glad if you considered my suggestions .
When I saw your advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper , I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you wrote in your advertisement . But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I look forward to hearing from you .
Write to me as soon as possible .
Hey , guess what : I helped a friend at a pop concert !
To sum up , there is no problem without a solution and if you are an active and broad-minded person , you will surely find a way to earn money even in the Arctic .
My first task was to open the doors to let in all the Britney Spears fans . I stood at the entrance and there I had to check the tickets . Two girls came together and they wanted to go in with only one ticket for both of them ! I had to tell one of them that she had to leave . She started crying . Such a poor girl ! At that moment I did n't like my position .
Dec. 16th , 2000
First of all , I would prefer to travel during the month of July , because I have already booked a holiday with my cousins in August .
How are you ? I am fine . Remember I told you that I had been selected to help at a pop concert of a local band ? Well , it turned out really well and everybody had a great time .
I look forward to hearing from you soon ,
It was the last time I trusted Pat .
4 . Canteen . Every day we go to the canteen to have lunch , no matter whether you buy food from there or you take your own food .
I was having a week 's holiday in London when I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical . I had read your advertisement in a newspaper and the show seemed very attractive to me . Moreover an English friend of mine had told me that it would really be a good show as Danny Brook was a very good actor .
17th June 2000
Yours faithfully
FINALLY I COULD N'T EAT EITHER . IN FACT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED , WHICH WAS NOT WHAT I 'D EXPECTED .
I think the people will wear convenient clothes with a simple design in the future . Because the people will stay at home more than now with their computer . And they will use soft cozy fabrics like cotton and silk .
The plays and films were really wonderful . People liked them very much , so could you have more next year ?
IN MY OPINION FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS THAT , IN SOME CASES , COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
ON THE OTHER HAND WE THOUGHT OF VISITING THE THEATRE RESTAURANT BUT IT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE THE SHOW DID N'T BEGIN AT 19:30 , AS WE HAD READ IN THE ADVERTISEMENT , IT BEGAN AT 20:15 .
Of course there is also a big disadvantage .
Dear Mr Jones ,
Our school basketball team is one of the best teenage teams in our city , and every afternoon students are all playing basketball in the playground . So , basketball should be filmed .
Yours sincerely
Hello Sir ,
Finally , could you give me your suggestion about money and clothes . What kinds of clothes are suitable to take with me and could I have any benefit from you for my trip or not . Could you please send me more information about this .
I 'm always very busy travelling from one country to another , you know .
Dear Mr Smith ,
Yours sincerely
Yours faithfully
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Shin Parade
I am writing to draw your attention to the musical show that took place yesterday evening . None of the conditions were fulfilled : firstly , Danny Brook , who was going to perform in the show , was changed for another actor . As a result it was a disappointing performance . Furthermore , the show started at 20:15 while the advertisement said that it was going to begin at 19:30 .
Dear Mr. Robertson ,
Lots of love ,
I am glad to provide all the information .
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
Yours sincerely ,
It 's a big advantage to go shopping with a friend , because he or she can bring you all the clothes in the right size if the item you took does n't fit . Often it happens that the salesman has n't got the size you need and that 's always a pity .
Nowadays , most people think that famous people have such a good life ( with lots of money , comfortable houses etc ) that they have to stop complaining about the media 's treatment , because they have chosen to have this kind of life .
Yours sincerely
For the women , too . If they ca n't find things which they expected , they go there only to get tired .
Secondly , I would like to stay in a log cabin because I think they 're more comfortable than tents , also because I do n't like to sleep in tents very much , I think they 're very cold during the night
Dear Sir ,
I am writing to reply to your letter about the holiday at Camp California in the U.SA which is the first prize in the competition which I fortunately won last month .
On the positive side , if I am bored , the first thing that I want to do is watch television or listen to music . And if I want to go shopping or to another city , it is necessary to use the car or public transport .
Weapons are designed to kill and defend in a fight . In the Second World War so many Germans were killed . Also many people died in other regions , e.g . the English .
I would like to know some more information about the Camp , before I leave . What clothes are most appropriate and how much money should I take with me ?
Dear Ms Ryan
Considering your activities at the Camp , I would choose singing and painting because I am the lead singer in the university band and I think I will be good at this activity . Also painting is my hobby because I have always painted when I have some spare time . I would be grateful if you could tell me some details about what type of clothes and how much money I should bring .
I have received your letter : I was very glad to know that I have won two weeks at Camp California . I have to take part in basketball competitions all year long , except during July , so that is the only month in which I can travel . I would be grateful if I could stay in a log cabin : I would prefer not to stay in a tent because of my height ; I am so tall that I could never stand up . I would like to play basketball because my trainer said that it would be advisable not to stop training during July . I can play basketball very well . I would be grateful if you could teach me to play golf . I have never tried this sport , so I ca n't play golf at all .
I am writing to thank you for notifying me about the competition and I would be very grateful to give to you the information that was requested in your letter .
yours faithfully
I am writing to you to complain about my unpleasant experience of visiting your theatre on May 21st . I had dreamt about visiting the Circle Theatre to see Danny Brook 's performance for a long time . As soon as I saw your advertisement in the 'Tourist Guide ' issue 46 , I decided to go at once .
International Arts Festival
Yours sincerely
Furthermore , we have been informed that students are allowed to visit this exhibition free . This event takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall in London , on Tuesday the 14th of March .
In conclusion , if you want to earn a bit of money , then you have to choose a proper part-time job . Because you will get some money as well as some career and knowledge . You must consider the purpose too . If you have n't a purpose , you will waste money easily and quickly .
I drove to Ouchy where I had a drink . It was so hot , I decided to go for a swim in tutry , although I had n't a swimming costume . I knew a good place . I parked the car and waited ten minutes . As I had planned , the place was deserted . I took my clothes off and swam for twenty minutes in the lake . Coming back , I noticed that my clothes were missing . I walked back , hoping I would n't come across anyone and be able to drive back home . The car was missing too .
This is my vision of the Home of the Future and I wish I could live in it .
Another point which I think was annoying was the concert hall . The concerts were great but the hall was too small for so many people . I hope that next year the concerts will take place in a bigger hall .
Well this is absolutely true , especially when you go shopping on Saturday . Everyone goes shopping on Saturday so the mall is always crowded , and most of the people are stressed . It 's crazy . For example , you go into a clothes shop , you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt , so they are looking everywhere , pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want . And then they have it and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you have chosen . And you have to wait after that to buy it , so finally you have waited so long that you have become late , so you get stressed too . So it 's really not enjoyable to go shopping . Plus , most of the time , you see all those mothers looking after their kids , and yelling their kids ' names in the shopping mall because they have lost them . So you get a headache because you hear the kids crying , the mothers yelling . If I can give you some advice : DO N'T GO SHOPPING ON SATURDAY ! ! You get headaches , you get stressed , and finally you get bruises because of the woman who pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you ! ! !
Yours sincerely .
That is all I would like to recommend you do . I would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us of your decision as soon as possible .
Yours
Firstly , the conference will take place in the Palace Hotel and we get from our college to there by bus . Number 45 bus goes there every 5 minutes . It takes 25 minutes , which is convenient for us . Secondly , there are some items on the programme that are great . First of all , the conference 's head makes a short speech and then we have dinner and drinks . Finally we enjoy a disco party so you should wear a suitable dress .
Yours faithfully
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I think modern technology has changed my daily life , especially when it comes to communication with my best friend , who is studying in Britain .
Henri
For me the most important thing is the telephone because without this you ca n't do anything . It 's part of my life .
Thank you for the letter you wrote to me to inform me about the prize I won . I was so happy ! I could n't believe it .
Shopping is not always enjoyable
A lot of bosses or workers in factories do not need to employ many clever workers because we do n't need a lot of them . This saves a lot of money for companies .
Apart from that , the advertisement mentioned that there were discounts available , and there were not . It mentioned that visitors could visit the restaurant after the show , too , and we could not because it was closed , and the person who was there said that it was very late and he was not allowed to open the restaurant for us .
Phat Cheung
Usually I go to a restaurant after theatre but this was also not possible because your theatre restaurant was closed because of the holiday . Why do you give this information in an advertisement ?
Finally , I should say that I had a very good time in spite of the flaws and I would like to thank you for it . I wish to enjoy an even better festival next year .
Mrs. Helen Ryan
Would you consider giving me my money back ? If a refund is available , that would be great .
If I pick up an example , the Kimono ( traditional Japanese clothing ) will be worn not only in Japan but also in other countries in general .
When the concert started , I was preparing some drinks for the band because after the concert they would be very tired and thirsty .
Cambridge , 13th June 2000
I liked all the stars and the artists who came from around the world , even if the number of countries was very small , only six . Why do n't you let more countries participate next year ?
My name is Yakimo Nashoto . I study in France and I went to London just to see `` Over the Rainbow '' because all my friends told me that it was `` great '' . However , when I saw it , I was really disappointed and I must ask you for some money back . The reasons why I was disappointed are as follows :
Yours faithfully ,
Yours sincerely ,
Regarding the time that I would like to travel , it must be in July only . This is because my A-level exams are coming up so I really need time to revise , and July is the only month that I am free .
Dear Elinor ,
At Camp California , I would preferably like to stay in a tent as I think it would be more enjoyable .
17 October 2000
Recommendations
To sum up I would say that even if shopping is not enjoyable we have to do it because we do not have another option .
Also it means meeting other people , having fun together , travelling to all the places on the island . I think that the summer makes people feel great , have fun , enjoy themselves . I believe that the summer is a season for everybody who wants to have a wonderful time and wonderful memories wherever they go .
To conclude , while our homes in the future will be much safer than before , they will still have good spaces for us to be at home .
To the manager of the Circle Theatre .
I remember this time in our class when we were talking for a long time about rules and I am missing that time so much .
When we arrived at the theatre we realised that there were no discount tickets available as were mentioned in your advertisement so we had to buy the most expensive ones . After that one of the theatre assistants told us that the show would begin at 20:15 instead of 19:30 as advertised . So we had to rest for a while and had a drink .
I look forward to hearing some news from you .
Firstly , I expected to see Danny Brook in the show , but he was replaced by another actor . Why was he not there ?
Because of all these reasons , which I have listed above , my evening , which should have been perfect , turned into a disaster . So I would like to have at least some of my money back as soon as possible .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I think one alternative is to buy your things on the Internet , because then you do n't have to invest a lot of time buying all these things , and they bring you the things to your home . In the end I think it is best if you have the chance to shop when there are not so many people because then you have enough time and you are not stressed .
Dear Maria Smith ,
Hunting on the high street , or the shopping malls for the desired bargain - because we ca n't afford to buy anything otherwise - often becomes a desperate attempt to attain a lifestyle promoted by the new consumerist society . And nobody can say they would rather go back to the stone age when money was not even invented .
I decided to do something for this man . My first move was to check whether there was any solid or liquid which could have blocked his airways . And I checked his body condition . After that I turned on the car 's lights in order to warn the passing cars .
I am very glad to help you with the International Student Conference . I hope that our friend Richard Brown does n't have any serious illnesses .
I am really surprised for the information because I won , and I would like to say thank you for everything . This is why I wrote and sent this letter with the information you needI can only travel in July because it is the only time when I can do it before for my workI do not really care what accommodation I will have . I would prefer to come in July I will be available for the moment . I would really appreciate it if you could tell the people who work at Camp California I choose the Golf and Photography because I think I am really interested in those subjects . I am not really really good but I have some experience . I would like to ask you what kind of clothes I need to take for the place and for the weather follow for the money , how much money do I need to take ? I think that is everything I would like to know . Thank you very much for your time .
As you know last month I went to help at a concert , the one that I told you about in my last letter . I wanted to go there very much and so going there to help was for me a unique opportunity . Moreover instead of buying a ticket I went there for free , as a helper .
You should n't miss the chance to see this castle because there is an excellent view and there are always a lot of people there and there are little shops where you can buy souvenirs .
Nevertheless , new technology has made me more lazy . I spend a lot of my free time watching TV , or surfing on the Internet or playing on the computer . Maybe it will change me into a kind of self-centred person , a loner .
In your last letter you said that you want to know about my experience at the pop concert . I enjoyed it very much . It was great ! There I helped with the special effects and the sound . They liked me so much and invited me to be responsible for the lights and sound . I told them that I will think about it but I believe I will accept the job .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Dear Mr Robertson ,
FINALLY , I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU LET ME KNOW IF I WILL HAVE TO TAKE SOME CLOTHES OR MONEY . I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF I WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY OTHER EXTRA ACTIVITIES .
Otto Zajac .
ONE MORE THING THAT IS CONCERNING ME AND WHICH YOU DID N'T MENTION . I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF IT 'S NECESSARY TO TAKE MONEY , FOOD AND CLOTHES WITH ME .
The queues are not the only problem . If you go by car there is the problem of parking , if you go by bus there are also queues and you have to carry a lot of carrier bag carrier bags during your journey and you wo n't always be lucky enough to find a seat .
Yours
About accommodation , I would prefer to stay in a tent because it will be a new experience for me . I like to have new experiences , especially when I am on holiday .
Conclusion
In the end I was happy that I had done this job . It was really a wonderful day .
We have more researchers than a few years ago and we will be able to find the solution to lots of problems . Actually , we can cure illnesses which were once very dangerous . I 'm sure that in a couple of years we will see some illnesses like cancer and UTH cured .
Dear Helen Ryan
I have never worked without a computer , but if we had n't any , we would find it normal .
Moreover , despite there being some restaurants in the theatre , they had already closed because it was too late . I wanted to have a coffee but I could not .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . That night my parents went out , so I had to stay home with Pat . I invited my best friends , and I asked Christian to bring some videos . We left Pat in her room with those videos , and we went to the top of the house , the third floor .
In my life , I use electricity in many different ways . At night , I can study because of it . And it also saves my time which would be used up doing housework such as laundry , cleaning rooms and ironing . It makes my life more convenient than it would be without it .
Lots of kisses and hugs
I am writing to tell you something about the three-day trip to London .
This is a great opportunity because as you know most people in our class are going to work in this sector so it would be very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education .
I bought the ticket for the evening performance to end the day with a nice musical . But the time was n't kept . I had to wait 45mins to get in ! So in order to keep myself occupied for a while , I went to the restaurant but it was n't open . I could n't see anyone inside either . No one .
Science and Technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays , most of the community of our city , and of the world , where technology has arrived , confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life . And I think it 's the same for me , because when advances in technology , like computers , Internet , etc. , were made , it changed my life as a high school student .
Here we have a lot of great things to do , but the best you can do in about three hours is visit the art museum .
In the 21st century , people will all the wearing the same clothes , the same shoes , they will be buying the same accessories . We 'll get up in the morning and find that our neighbour wears the same jacket and he 's boasting about a pair of shoes which are too similar to ours .
After school Larry and I went to the cinema , but at the entrance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us . Larry told me that she is his girlfriend and then I told them I had to go home . When they asked me the reason I told them that I promised my Mom to stay in with her . They said OK and I went home . When I closed my bedroom door I burst into tears . I do n't know how long I cried ...
Shopping is not always enjoyable because of several factors .
Everyone has likes and dislikes . But no one does what he likes all the time . There are times when you have to do something even if you do n't like it , and times when you are doing what you like but not at the time you would like to . What I 'm trying to say is that I like to shop but I ca n't do that all the time . First because I 'm not so rich and second because I do n't enjoy shopping all the time . Nothing in life is always enjoyable , not even the things we enjoy doing , and that 's how life is . You say you enjoy shopping . I understand but life goes on . You ca n't do the same things every day . Live your life and try to do different things and you will see that doing different things is exciting and more fun . You do n't have to be bored with the same old things .
I was very disappointed . In addition the concert did n't start on time . It was a quarter of an hour late . If I had known that the show was going to be late , I would have asked my mom to come with me , because her working day ended at eight o'clock . The restaurant was closed after the show ended . Also there were no discounts available . As a result I had to pay extra for the tickets .
Once again , congratulations on the Festival .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show in London . It will be on the 14th and we all want to go . So , it would be great if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Ms Ryan
First of all , thank you for the good programme . We saw the details and were pleased with them , especially the river trip to Greenwich and visiting the National Art Gallery .
Manuel P. Martinez
The reality was that Marine 's parents were not her real parents , they found her in their house 's garden . They tried so many things to find her family . For a year they did everything to find her family but they could n't find them . In this one year they spent most of their time with Marine and they loved her so much and they wanted to be her parents . When Marine was three years old a man came to their house and said that he was Marine 's father and he wanted to take her , and he added that he left Marine because her mother died two days after Marine 's birth and the police thought Marine 's father did this so they put him in prison . He had nobody that he could give Marine to so he left her in their garden . Marine 's real father wanted her back but the other couple did n't want to give her back because they loved Marine so much . They gave a lot of money to Marine 's real father to keep her . After that Marine 's father took the money & left her . The couple could n't tell the truth to Marine because they were afraid of losing her .
Secondly , in your advertisement the time of the show was 19:30 and in reality the show started at 20:15 and the discount was not available .
Is there anything happening over there ? Please write to me when you have time . I am looking forwards to hearing from you .
I 'm a good swimmer and I would like to do it in the Californian sea . I do n't think I 'll have the chance to do it again in the future .
Also , I have been asking a lot of people in the street : Could you live without a telephone ? The answer was always the same : `` Impossible '' . An old woman told me how important the phone was when her only son was abroad studying computers at `` Chicago University '' . She told me that every night she expected a call from her son , because her was the line of the happiness .
Of course , I could enjoy this concert , as well
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . Last Wednesday Carole received a letter . The stamp was from a foreign country and the address was written in Capital Letters . She did n't recognize the writing . She began to read , `` Dear Carolin.. '' There was only one person who used to call her by this name . It brought a lot of memories back to her . It was long time ago , when she was fourteen and Paul sixteen . He was her first love and also the first who kissed her . Paul had to move to Mexico because of his father 's work . When they were saying goodbye Paul said , `` I will be the last person who will kiss you '' . `` It sounds nice but I do n't believe it , '' she replied . `` You only have to wait , '' he said . But she did n't wait . She got married and had two children . At the time Carole was living with her husband but they did n't love each other any more . Their love had finished . In his letter Paul said that he had become a rich man and he would come back to meet her again . Her friend Pat had explained the whole story to her husband . What would she do ?
According to your advertisement , the actor should have been Danny Brook , but in fact it was a different person . My ticket was for 19.30 , but it started very late . It started at 20:15 . When the show finished , it was too late to catch the train home . I had to take a taxi . It cost me £30 . `` What a waste ! , , By the way , I did n't see any discounts on tickets . One more thing , the theatre restaurant was closed when I went there for a drink . I do n't know why . There was no note or information about that . I am not sure that I did have a perfect evening out .
Yours faithfully
Therefore I ask you to give us £20 back , because the two tickets were not worth more . I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
EXPLAIN
I hope I have n't been too `` demanding '' .
Dear manager ,
Do famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time ?
We should n't disregard and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college , especially if we take into consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespeare . It will be good advertising , and will help to make the reputation of our college even better .
Faithfully yours ,
I am very glad to hear that I have won first prize in your competition . Here is some further information you need from me :

But if I have n't got enough money to spend or if I am sad shopping is not always enjoyable , because without money and being sad it is not a good idea to go shopping .
Yours sincerely
Helen Ryan
As a child , I would be taken to the mall and be forced to go through all the shops and establishments just to please my mother , whose desire to buy , without any sort of control , all kinds of clothes and gadgets was something unbelievable . And due to these bizarre experiences I went through as a little boy , everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I 'm forced to drink .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
Besides that the most important thing is that these children have an easy adolescence and they have n't got psychological problems and they are useful in society .
First of all , I am a student and would like to travel in July . This is because I intend to take an examination in September . So I can afford to go on holiday only in July . Secondly , I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents . It will be my first time experiencing staying there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried .
First , I am only able to come in July , because my examination session is due from the 24 June till 26 June .
Moreover , the stars and artists were from only six countries . In my opinion , if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries , it will make the festival more exciting , more interesting , and in my opinion , some of the concert halls were too small . The people in there could n't even go to the loo , because it was too crowded . Finally , the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed , as far as I 'm concerned . If you can have more plays and films , it will have a good effect .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
On the other hand there are some disadvantages . For example if you are a working mother with three children , which means you are always in a hurry , going shopping is really unenjoyable . You shop in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue .
13th June 2000
In addition it is proper to mention that all the students in my class are interested in going to The London Fashion and Leisure Show , which is taking place on Tuesday 14th in the Central Exhibition Hall .
More and more people , everywhere , are becoming shopping addicts . Maybe you think I am exaggerating but recent studies prove that this mania can be really dangerous .
Yours sincerely ,
Nowadays , especially in the western area of the world , science and technology have taken great , enormous steps in the direction of progress . Not only for the great nations , but also for each of their inhabitants .

Dear Miss Ryan ,
Yours sincerely ,
At first it was a great pleasure for me to get a ticket because I 'm one of Danny Brook 's greatest fans . It 's not that problem that there was no more discount available - but I had chosen it , because I 'm ( allowed ? ) .
After the show I went to visit the restaurant as it is supposed to be very famous and apart from that I wanted to have a drink . In the end I had to go home as it was closed because the coffee pot did not work . What nonsense !
Firstly , it was written that Danny Brook would be performing in it , but in fact he was n't . I was very disappointed when I saw someone I 've never heard of . In addition to this , the time , 19.30 , was n't correct . We wasted our time waiting outside in the cold until the doors opened 45 minutes late .
I am interested in tennis but I am not so good a tennis player . However , I would like to attend tennis activity . In addition swimming would be a good activity for me . While I was studying at the high school and the university , I was in the swimming team .
The activities you offer are really interesting . I would like to take part in a painting course and I would like to get to know how to handle a camera .
We would be very grateful if you could change our programme for Tuesday afternoon . We are thinking here particularly of the fact that we can go to the show , instead of shopping .

At my school , we are n't allowed to smoke inside the building , because the building is made of wood . It tends to catch fire easily , and we are n't allowed to use the Internet . There are only ten computers in the school . Only teachers can use them . If we used them , we would be sent to the head office of the school .
Dear Mrs Helen Ryan ,
Seeing that this is the first year of drama lessons , it is not very well known . Also they are putting on their first play on the 2nd of July . Part of the show could be filmed .
The job was hard , but , from my point of view , it was worthwhile . I have learned lots of things , earned some money for the summer , and the most important thing : I have had fun .

In our school we have a system of `` double lessons '' . It means that every day except Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for an hour and a half and it means a `` double lesson '' . I think that is more convenient than seven lessons every day and each of the lessons lasts forty-five minutes . It is convenient , I mean `` double '' lessons , because you have more time to understand the material which is given out and because you have to prepare only four subjects for `` tomorrow '' and it is fewer then seven subjects .
I am writing concerning the trip I have won in your competition .
Conclusion .
The only problem is that the show is going to take place on Tuesday 14th March , so I 'm wondering if you can make some changes to your programme . My class think that it is a great opportunity for them to see the show , because Tuesday is the last day that the show is going to be showed .
On the one hand technology has made our lives more comfortable and easier . On the other hand we have faced some problems , such as social and environmental problems .
Dear Mrs Smith , Hello Maria . In this letter you will get all the information that you need .
However , there was something good for me . I saw a lot of singers and entertainers . I did n't need to pay an entrance fee because I was working there .
See you soon
Can you tell me what clothes I should take with me for which two weeks . What kind of weather do you have at this time of year ?
But , the principal reason for this letter is to ask for some money back . I think that would be best for everyone , and I 'd like to give you some advice ; if somebody pays you for a ticket , try to give the best you can .
So , the show was not good at all and my evening was spoiled in spite of all that the advertisement promised . As things went that way , I want my money back .
Many people , especially women , love shopping . If you go to the centre of any big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat . But shopping is not always enjoyable .
See you soon ,
I 'm looking forward to receiving your prompt reply .
After that I prepared the group . I did their make-up for them . I was very happy because during this time I had a chance to talk to them and to find out more about them . They are very nice people . Even Audrey who seems very stupid . She is very intelligent . I really do n't know why she behaves so badly during her interview . I got their address so we can visit them one day .
That 's when she showed me my wallet and said she had found it on the seat at the eating-place at the shopping center that I went to that day !
Actually I did n't use to enjoy pop music much . My classmate Cecilia persuaded me to try the whole new experience of helping at a pop concert . I thought it would be the last thing I wanted , but it was n't . I 've really enjoyed this opportunity . We delivered so many fantastic and gorgeous costumes which had been designed exclusively by top designers . We also helped to make posters and leaflets , which I enjoyed most as I always like drawing and designing .
Dear Sir/Madam , I am writing to you to complain about the musical show I went to see last Wednesday . I was told I would have the most perfect evening in London , but it was not . When I bought my ticket I expected to be able to take advantage of those discounts you announced in the newspaper advertisement but then I had to pay the most expensive price . I went to see the 19:30 performance but it did not start until 20:15 ! I was really angry but I wanted to see Danny Brook . My surprise was when , instead of Mr. Brook , a different actor appeared on stage . At the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but when I arrived I realized it was closed because the show had finished too late ! All I am asking for is a full refund of the money I spent on the musical . I look forward to hearing from you . Yours faithfully ,
Firstly , on Monday morning we can visit the presentation of the latest fashions and in the afternoon we could take a sightseeing bus . Secondly , on Tuesday morning we can see the leisure wear and sportswear and in the afternoon we can go to the Science Museum and finally , on Wednesday , we can go and see the presentation of different hairstyles and make-up , spending the afternoon in the National Art Gallery .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
Counting the pros and cons , I tend to think that there are more positive points to working out and manufacturing new technologies than negative ones anyway . A modern girl or boy is already unable to imagine life without them .
Dear Kim ,
Anyway , in my country , generally , children are free at home , but it also depends on their parents . For me , I do n't have rules at home - I just do n't make trouble for my family . That 's all .
Dear Madam
Secondly , the show should have started at 19:30 p.m. , and it began forty-five minutes late .
To sum up , I ca n't think what my life would be like without technology .
I can only travel in July because this is the month when I have holidays . I 've already talked to my manager , and she said that that 's the only month I can have my holidays .
Pat could n't resist and told her brother Jacob . He was quite shocked about the news because he misunderstood . He understood that 'Carlotta wants to kill Charles but she is still thinking about it . ' Jacob runs as fast as sound to get to Charles 's house . There , Jacob approaches him slowly and tells him .
I always had considered myself to be very lucky to be born in the century because of all the amazing human inventions .
Write back to me soon and tell me about your impression of the story ( I mean if you enjoyed the story or not ! )
Last month , Alice and her friends suggested to me that I help at a pop concert . The group which was singing was very famous and I was able to meet them and to chat about their plans for the future .
Closing these facts , when the musical finished I was very , after waiting for the start of the musical and I was disappointed with this version of Over the Rainbow . Everybody went to the restaurant , which was closed without any explanation .
Maybe in 500 years , some people will live on Mars and then they will have to wear other kinds of clothes . But I do n't think these clothes are going to be a fashion on the earth . They just look funny !
Finally the day to pay my credit card arrived and where was my money ? I started to look everywhere . I asked my mom and my friends and nobody knew where it was . My mom said :
Brenda
What 's more , the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished , because the show started at 20:15 . It should have started at 19:30 as you said in your advertisement , and you should not have closed it before the show finished .
I helped at a new group 's pop concert and you ca n't imagine how exciting it was !
Now what 's going to be the same ? Well as I said , if you 're poor , the government will still give you a flat but a very ugly one , probably with rats in it . The same problem will be with homeless people who do n't have money at all , even to buy food for themselves . They will have to stay on the streets as the streets are their home .
Yours sincerely ,
Secondly , I think the FCE class should be filmed . Most of us ( students ) came to our school because they wanted to study English , so it should be the important part . In addition , if we film the class , people can see how interesting or funny the lesson is .
Best Regards ,
Dear Mr Robertson ,
One day she invited me to her flat . Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together on the weekend usually . We had a fantastic time together for three months . We could even make a trip to Paris in the school holiday ! We had many common interests in music , art and books .
Thank you very much for your letter . I 'm very surprised to win this prize . About the information , I would like to travel in July because it 's only the month when I have a vacation . It 's very difficult to change it . About the accommodation at Camp California , I would prefer tents because I like the countryside and I like to listen to the birds . At the camp I would like to play tennis and golf . My level in these two activities is medium . I never practise them both . I would like to ask you some questions .
Dear Mrs Ryan
What I would like to know about is what kinds of clothes suit the season in the U.S.A and how much money I should bring to the camp .
Could you please tell me what sort of clothes I need and how much money to take .
I have never tried surfing , but every time I see surfing on television I find it magical .
The price of the ticket was another problem . Your advertisement says 'discounts available ' but it was not available . I did not get a discount . I really liked your idea of visiting your theatre restaurant , but because of the late start of the show , the restaurant was closed by the end of the show .
Sincerely yours ,
In my opinion , my daily life is full of modern technology . I meet it `` at every corner '' : at home , at school , in the backyard and so on . It also changed my lifestyle for the better - I think . Every morning I use a toaster to have my sandwiches done , a washing machine which makes my clothes clean again . Today , modern technology means : mobile phones , computers , the Internet , super-fast cars etc . These improvements help me with my ordinary chores . I can do my homework on a computer , prepare for the class test by searching for information on the Internet and use a mobile phone every time I want to talk with one of my parents .
And the last question I have -
Society has to go forward not to stop in one place .
Also , the times printed in your advertisement were 14.30 and 19:30 . I went to the 19:30 show , but it did not start until it was 20:15 . I had my evening planned out and I was not pleased that the show started forty-five minutes late .
Anyway , we 'll give up wearing fur coats as it is cruel and uncivilised .
Thank you for the chance to do two activities . I would like to choose Tennis and Photography . I have played tennis since I was ten years of age . In my opinion tennis is the best sport I have ever played . Another activity which I have chosen is photography . I have just finished a professional photography course and I would like to continue my education in this activity .
Very soon , Lise understood that it was useless to continue pretending that she knew nothing about it , and decided to make a deal with her class mates . She would give them the exam 's questions and they would do all her homework for 3 weeks .
When we saw your advertisement for the musical show , over the rainbow , we immediately decided that this would be a perfect evening out . There were in our opinion two reasons for that , our favourite actor Danny Brook and the opportunity to visit your theatre restaurant afterwards .
While we work at the office , there are the computer and equipment to help us to work and easy . After we have finished work , we come back home , and there is the television for get information , news , data by different way and quickly .
Many people think that it is natural for famous people to be followed by journalists all the time because they are famous and everybody is curious about their life . However , in my opinion , famous people , such as politicians and film actors , deserve to have a private life .
Thanks for your programme , we are all especially looking forward to Monday 13 March because we will see all the monuments in London .
Some people think that they should . They are human beings and they need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people , to feel that they are unknown and anonymous and they do not have to wear sunglasses , hats or caps every time they want to leave home in order not to be recognised .
I am sending you some pictures , the best ones only because there were some quite embarrassing ones .
This is why , for all of these good reasons , I am asking for some money back .
No one will walk on roads . They will bounce on roads with their balloon clothes .
I would like some kind of explanation and to get my money back . If you do n't agree , I will act .
I am really mad and I want my money back . Please call me on the number 23456789 , I will be waiting for your call . Thank you for your time
Now , I would like to request some information about clothes and money . What type of clothes and how much money should I take with me ?
I am in doubt as to what kind of clothes I have to bring with me . And may I also ask you how much money I have to take with me .
Yours sincerely ,
Your really dissatisfied customer
Some weeks later when Pat was walking to school she met Sally , who had just come out of Paul 's house . Now Pat realized what was going on and could understand why her boyfriend got so nervous about the secret . He was Sally 's lover !
What type of clothes should I bring with me ? And is there any equipment I need to bring with me ? I would like to know how much money I need to spend while camping .
Madam ,
During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows at the `` Circle Theatre '' . The show was called `` Over the rainbow '' and should be , to quote the advertisement , London 's newest and best musical show . But I was very disappointed . I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . When I saw that you had changed Danny Brook for someone else I was very disappointed .
Yours sincerely ,
Victoire
If we compare a person who lived a very long time ago with another one who lives now , we will see a very big difference between their clothes .
If looking after children does n't suit you , you can try the same thing with pets . Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk . So if you like animals this is your chance to earn some money and have fun at the same time .
There are many facts to prove that shopping is not `` pretty and harmonious '' , so believe me , it is not always enjoyable .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Henri Devereux
I wait to receive a prompt answer from you .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Thank you very much for your letter . I just received it yesterday . I am very excited .
Finally , there are many shops inside the building . You will have a good time shopping .
I use different technological things every day . Such as a mobile phone that helps me to communicate with anyone in the world , even if I am not at home ; I use a stereo if I want to listen to my favourite music ; I use tapes , CDs , hairdryers , etc . I think that all these things have made my life much easier . Many years ago people did n't have an opportunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot . I am very happy that with all the technology that we have we do n't have to work as much as they did , doing things like washing plates and cups after meals . My dishwasher will do that for me , and I do n't have to wash my clothes , my washing machine does it better . Of course it is a bit sad that machinery is taking over from humans and of course it makes me lazy . However , now I have more freedom , free time , and privacy .
From :
The ways we travel are improving a lot at present . Cars are really useful and a lot faster than walking or cycling . But cars create pollution : for example the greenhouse effect . But it is also technology which tries to resolve this problem with new means of transport such as subways or busses so as to have less cars in the cities .
I am grateful to you for offering a well-organised programme , especially , the London fashion and leisure show which is difficult for us to take part in .
As I only have holidays in July I would like to travel in this month .
On the other hand , the main disadvantage is that using modern machines can be very difficult for elderly people ; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries trained people to use modern technologies .
Dear Sir ,
I saw your advertisement about the International Arts Festival now . I think that 's a great idea as we need some good activities . The advertisement states that you invite stars and artists from around the world . This is incredible but you wrote down artists from only six countries . I think you should invite people from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world . If you invite stars and artists from more countries , your festival will be unbelievable . The second point is there are some jazz , rock and classical concerts . It 's a good idea but some concert halls are too small . Because of this , people are bored quickly . You show plays and films . I congratulate you because that 's perfect . The most important thing is dance shows
How are you ? I 'm fine . I 'm so excited . Last month I was helping at a pop concert with a few friends of mine . It was a Tina Turner concert ! At this moment when I think of it I want to shout .
First of all , Danny Brook was supposed to act , but he was replaced by another actor . This situation made me feel very disappointed .
Today I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe . Last month I received a letter which told me that I 'd won a competition . I was so happy and surprised that first I could not really believe it . But it was true . My prize was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at their concert . The pop group which was going to play is called `` Metallica '' and I like their music very much ( 'cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to ) . But now to the concert itself . It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg . It started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am . First I had to help with the catering , which lasted until 2 pm . After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal . The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal . I was so excited that I was not able to eat anything either . At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guided tour for the journalists . I had to show them the way to the interviewing room . It was a bit boring but more or less okay . At 7 p.m. the first group started . They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I realised that they were very nice . At 8 pm Metallica started and , I have to tell you , they gave a great performance . When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like `` Did you like the performance ? '' or `` What do you think about the first group ? '' Questions like you and I usually ask each other . You know what I mean . They were not conceited or anything like that . They were like other people and I have to admit that I like them very much . This was one of the best and most exciting days of my life .
As I told you in my last letter , last month I worked for a pop band , and helped them at a concert in Barcelona . It was such a great experience !
SUBJECT : Recommendations for a place to visit
Yours faithfully ,
Then I realized that Danny Brook did not appear in the show , which was very diappointing for me because I like this actor very much , and I think that I was not the only one who was upset .
NOWADAYS , PEOPLE ALWAYS SEEM TO BE WORRIED . ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY ON CLOTHES .
13.06.2000
Dear Mrs Ryan :
If you do n't mind I would like to know what kind of clothes are appropriate for the camp and for the Californian weather . And also will I have to bring any money ? I know that all the expenses are paid but it could be necessary for other things .
At that time , I used to buy a lottery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts . One day , while I was checking my weekly ticket , I found out that I had five numbers out of six so that I would surely get a substantial amount of money .
Suggesting places to film .
Do you want to earn money ?
It seems ages since I wrote to you . How have you been ? How 's your new flat ? When I received your letter with photographs of that flat , it really looked nice . Anyway , I 'll tell you about my wonderful experience which I enjoyed at a pop concert .
In conclusion , I was n't at all satisfied , and I would like my money back since the show was n't worth it .
Yours faithfully ,
REASONS FOR RECOMMENDATION .
We look forward to hearing from you soon .
There is another thing I would like to know . What kind of clothes should I bring with me ? And how much money can I take with me ?
When I arrive there , I would like to do painting and take a photography course because both of these are my hobbies . I have been doing a lot of them when I have had some free time and when I feel impressed with where I have been . I think I can do these things very well .

If you work in a fast-food restaurant you can work in the afternoon , or during the night , and so you have time for yourself .
And there should be a robotic servant in everyone 's home . So there 'll be no need for people to do the housework . There will be no beds at home because some pills will be invented to prevent people becoming sleepy . If you 're tired , the pill can give you vitamins , proteins and make you refreshed .
It is the main building of LUTON University in Park Square . It is an academic building . It includes a library , II suit , academic rooms , a GYM Club and a restaurant .
Where the stories are concerned , they will not be difficult to understand because you already know the stories and the narators are going to read clearly . What I 'd like to say is you should listen to them .
I would like to complain about four things concerning your theatre . First thing , the actor is really horrible so I recommend you change the actor because he will disappoint an audience who visits your theatre .
You would n't believe how hard it was . The stage was covered with all sorts of light and we made it look like a waterfall .
I 'd like to tell you about my experiences . Before that , you have to think about why you need to earn money and how you do that . It is really important because making money needs a proper purpose .
Dear Mr Robertson !
We are all very interested in the show because English people have a different kind of life . It is also unusual to have such a great opportunity in our country .
Shopping is not always enjoyable
First of all , I would like to travel in July because I am planning to visit my Mum in Korea in August . I also prefer staying in log cabins to tents . I have once experienced having been soaked while I was sleeping in a tent due to heavy rain several years ago . One more reason is that I do not want to miss the chance to stay in a log cabin , which I have been dreaming of for a long time . How romantic it will be ! As for my activities , as I took up playing golf when I was a child and now , I am a single-handicapped player , so I want to have a chance to play golf at camp . Moreover , I am very good at singing as well as playing the piano . In fact I have been playing the piano for a children 's choir for 5 years .
From the list of all the activities I have chosen photography and golf . Since secondary school I have been very interested in taking pictures and I have broad experience of it . I have chosen golf because I have never played this game .
Thank you for your kind attention and I hope that my advice will be useful .
I ask you if it is possible to have my money back , please , because I want to forget that expense . Thank you .
I 've a few questions to ask . Since all accommodation and travel costs are paid for , are there any other expenses that I have to meet ? How much money should I have with me in order to cover all other expenses ? Furthermore , what type of clothes should I bring ?
In conclusion , I was very disappointed in the whole of the show . Furthermore , , I could not enjoy my holiday after the show . Therefore , I would like you to refund some money . I look forward to recieving your prompt reply .
For the party I suggest you wear classic clothes ; maybe something black and not red or pink . I am going to wear classic black trousers and a white jersey - it might be that this information gives you some idea too .
Yours sincerely ,
When I am at Camp , I will choose singing and photography . I can sing classical music and pop music , seem like rock & roll . Maybe TITANIC . My mum likes me singing this song . And I can also take very good photographs , because I learned to do this in China two years ago .
Thank you for your letter which I received last week .
To answer your last question , I would propose you attend the local zoo , because many baby animals have been born in the past few days .
Yours sincerely ,
'Fashion of the Future ' ! This is not a taboo subject with me and my friends . We have discussed it a lot of times . I think it is important and necessary to think about it , because our children will live in the future .
They ate with the owner of the little house , whose name was John . It was very quiet because they were in the countryside ; they could just hear the cows and John 's two dogs .
I knew I would not come to this world again , everyone has only one chance to do whatever they want
your friend for ever .
We can hear many people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping . It is a kind of relief for them .
I 'm very sorry I have n't written to you for such a long time but I had to make a trip to my parents ' house because my mother had an operation ; do n't worry , she is all right now .
Firstly , we have a nice interesting museum , it is located near the hotel .
Pat kept this a secret for two months but one day revealed it by accident to a boy in her class . In a few days all the school knew Kim 's story . Kim was terrified because everyone was making fun of her and she was very angry with Pat .

I 'm writing to complain about what happened to me two days ago , during your musical show `` OVER THE RAINBOW '' . A friend of mine went to see it last May . He told me to go because the actor 's performance was good .
It takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14 March . It will be a great opportunity because it is free for students and we will be able to see the latest fashions in leisure and sports wear , new hairstyles and make-up .
To finish , I wonder if I need to bring some money or if everything has been already paid for and what kind of clothes should I bring ?
We are living in the 21st century and everybody is surrounded by advanced technology . As a result of all this advanced technology , I became one of the daily users of modern technology . Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages .
Dear Mrs. Smith
These are my suggestions . I hope you will listen to my suggestions . This will make the festival better . I hope we will meet next year at the festival .
Could you tell me something about the clothes and money which I need to take with me .
That was my situation at the time .
Yours sincerely
In addition to this I would like to ask you what kind of clothes and how much money is necessary to have , since I am undecided about it , not knowing the cost of living in California .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Dear Sir
We suggest you change the programme . We think that Monday and Wednesday are good , but we ask you to change the programme on Tuesday . If it is possible , we want to go to the `` London Fashion and Leisure Show '' and not go shopping .
First of all , I think more than half the population of Britain has a `` mobile phone '' . They are small and compact , much lighter than a home telephone , and one of the biggest advantages is you can carry it , so that it is easy to contact your friend or someone who other , even they can easily contact you as well , so you can phone anytime you want , whenever you want .
So , you ca n't believe how disappointed I was when I saw that it was closed , with no explanation .
I have a friend , his name is Peter , he is my best friend .
The activities I would like to do during my stay are golf and surfing .
Finally , I have one question about the money . What things must I pay for on my trip ?
Spending a week in London on holiday last week , I decided to go to the theatre in order to see your wonderful musical show . Unfortunately , I had a really disappointing evening ! Indeed , first , the performance did n't start at 19:30 as it was meant to according to the advertisement but 45 minutes later ( 20:15 ) .
I would like to answer your questions about this trip . First of all , I 'm living in Leeds and also studying English at a college . Therefore , I need to wait until my college 's lessons have finished . If possible I would prefer to come in July . Before now , I have usually stayed in log cabins , but I have never had the chance to stay in a tent . In my opinion , staying in tents is more exciting than staying in log cabins . That 's why I would love to live in a tent for 2 weeks !
Definitely , it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances I really believe you should give me my money back .
I would like to know if it is possible for me to go in July , because I have school in the other months , and it is impossible for me to go in December or January .
I would like to know something about money and clothes . Are they included in the prize ? How much money can I spend during this time ? I 'd prefer it if you gave me this information as soon as you can .
Here is my report for American students who want information on an interesting building to visit in Ankara . I would like to describe 'Anitkabir '
However , it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable , for example before Christmas or during some special sales . In these periods of the year , the supermarkets and the shops are full of stressed adults and tired children trying to walk in a hot and noisy place .
LONDON
Firstly , the hotel which has been booked for you is Palace Hotel which is located close to the conference . In order to get from the hotel to the conference , you just need to take the bus we will provide . Secondly , the end-of-conference party will take place in the same hall as the conference at 6 p.m. , which includes dinner and an announcement by the president of the conference . The party is arranged as a casual party , therefore , you can wear comfortable clothes . You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well . Finally , if you want to have an exciting experience here , I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals . As you may have heard , our city is well known for the musicals . Or , if you want to relax , you can take a walk in the park situated at ten minutes ' distance on foot from the hotel . Whatever you choose , you will be satisfied with your choice .
That is why I think that modern technology helps me in my daily life .
I received your letter , which says I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A . I appreciate that and I thank you sincerely for having chosen me as a winner . I accept and I want to inform you that I can travel only in July because I have booked my annual leave for that period . Also , I prefer to stay in tents because I have memories from my childhood . Every year my parents used to send me to Camps in the mountains so I would like to stay for a while in the same type of accommodation and environment . Also , I prefer swimming and painting . I started to learn how to swim when I was 7 years old . My parents took me to the seaside every weekend so I got used to being in the water all seasons . I have taken part in races twice in my life , where I was successful . Also , I have liked painting from an early age , and I have taken part in a public exhibition , where I won first prize . I would like to ask how much money I should have with me and where can I keep it ? What about the clothes ? You do n't mention anything about them . Do I need something special or can I wear ordinary clothes ?
I am writing to complain about the musical which was performed at The Circle Theatre last week . I saw the performance and it was not as it was described in the advertisement I read in the local newspaper .
Thank you .
Thank you very very much and please keep in contact by e-mail , or normal mail .
should be more . Secondly , the concerts took place in concert halls which in my opinion were too small . That was the reason why some people were complaining .
On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine . We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical `` Over the Rainbow '' at the `` Circle Theatre '' . We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets , but , when we arrived , a long line of people were standing there , waiting to get tickets . After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets , we had to wait 45 minutes until it started . One of the reasons why I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook , but he did n't appear ! So when the miserable musical came to its end , we were happy to leave the theatre auditorium , but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant , because no restaurants were open anymore , because it started too late . So we went upstairs to find the restaurant , but we just found a big empty hall , with nothing in it , with a small sign on a door : `` Sorry , we are closed for renovations '' ! We thought it was a joke , but it was n't . Because you are the manager , I think you are the only person who can change anything . I would prefer to get my money back , instead of getting a lawyer . I will never visit your theatre again !
Yours sincerely ,
I am writing to you to give you the information you need , but first of all I want to say that I am really delighted and I would like to thank you .
Dear Ms Jane Clark ,
I went to your annual international arts festival . I really enjoyed it , although I feel it could have been better . But firstly , I want to congratulate you on organizing such a huge festival , people need this kind of event . Secondly , I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it . As it said so in your advertisement , artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented . I was quite disappointed . However the concerts were great , but unfortunately , some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as an oven inside .
Is that enjoyable ?
Dear Kim ,
Yours sincerely
I would be very grateful , if you gave me the possibility of singing . I 've always wanted to learn to sing professionally , but I 've never had an opportunity . I 'm very keen on swimming , too . Normally , I live by the seaside and I could n't live without this sport . Last year I was even champion of my school in crawl for one hundred meters .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
lausanne , the 17th of June 2000

Yours sincerely
The name of the building is 'Sunshine 60 ' . This is the tallest building in Tokyo . I recommend visiting it . I have three reasons for my recommendation .
So I want my money back for these two tickets - I have included a copy of them - and I hope you will pay more attention to the way you treat your customers , and avoid false advertising .
Yours sincerely
Then we expected to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . We did see Tina Truelove but we did not see Danny Brook . That was very disappointing .
I look forward to your reply .
They did n't respect the timetable , the show was meant to begin at 19:30 and it started at 20:15 . How can you explain this mistake ? !
I write to complain about the show `` Over the Rainbow '' I saw last night . Firstly I was very disappointed to find out that unheard-of actors were playing instead of the ones we all expected .
Finally , I would like to ask you to give me some money back .
The place I would like to recommend is the seventeenth-century Royal Palace . It is situated in the heart of Warsaw and surrounded by the buildings of the Old Town . There is an old market square with the magnificent statue of King Zygmunt in the centre of it .
I 'm writing this letter to explain the reasons for our disappointment with that evening .
At first I felt really annoyed and disappointed so I ran to my brother in order to tell him what I had seen .
A long time ago , there were two brothers , whose parents were dead . Their parents were rich , so when they passed away they left a lot of money .
I enjoyed a lot participating in your competition and hope to enjoy the trip I have won .
Nowadays , fashion plays a big role in our daily life . A million kinds of fashion magazines and newspapers tell you how much people are interested in fashion .
Suddenly , the door was opened .
Yours sincerely ,
The Home of the Future
Dear Sir ,
Secondly , I would like to ask you for some information . Would you be kind enough to tell me what kind of clothes I should bring with me ? Could you possibly tell me how much money I might spend at California Camp ? Would you recommend me bringing some equipment , like a rope , sticks , with me ?
Who would like to be famous ?
First of all , I would like to thank you for your activity programme . I find it really good , especially because of the visit to the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery .
I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement for the Circle theatre said about the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow ' and the things I noticed when I was there .
In conclusion , the advertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out , but it was not , so I would like to ask for my money back .
I hope to see you soon .
Dear Kim ,
Dear Sir ,
I look forward to hearing from you .
Well I think that is all , but I will ask you to give me my money back .
You also asked me about two activities . I choose singing because I love singing and I have been in a choir for 7 years now . I also choose climbing . Unfortunately I am not so good at it . But I would take the opportunity to improve .
In conclusion , even though we know that this character is good and this one is bad , sometimes the good ones are quite boring , and we find the bad ones much more interesting .
I have TV 's and radios so I can watch or listen to various news and I do n't have to go to football stadiums to see how the players are playing .
I am writing to you to explain what my experience was like in the theatre last Friday . I did not expect all the problems that I had .
Firstly , you spoke about two actors , Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but instead of them we had two others and they were really bad . So I was really surprised . In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late . It was boring for everybody . How could we appreciate the show properly .
Moreover , the work I had to do , apart from carrying equipment , was essentially to sell tickets for the concert , which allowed me to meet a lot of nice people and to become friends with some of them . Even though my entire body aches ( the equipment was quite heavy ) and I am tired , I would n't call it work ! I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Modern technology has completely changed my daily life , which has become more comfortable , and easier .
I think that the most disappointing thing was that the theatre 's restaurant was closed . I would add that I was hungry after the show .
Before catching our plane , we will be able to enjoy going shopping around the airport for three hours in the afternoon , because there are so many unique shops and you should buy good gifts for your parents
Another thing that is different from your schools is that we do n't change classrooms between periods . We stay in the class in which we have been registered for the whole year , and a different teacher comes in every period .
Yours sincerely ,
On the other hand , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would all like to go the show . We think it is a good opportunity because London fashion is the most important in the world , and we all will learn a lot about London style going to this show .
I am writing to you about your production : 'over the rainbow ' . I went to a performance and I am very disappointed . Firstly , your advertisement said the actor would be Danny Brook , but it was not . It was another actor who played very badly . Secondly , the musical should start at 19.30 , but we had to wait until 20.15 ! It was boring that nothing happened for such a long time on the stage . Did you know that you have no discounts on your tickets ? I could not believe that . Why do you write things on your advertisement that are not true ? And finally , I would have had my dinner after this disappointing musical and thought I would go to 'Theatre restaurant ' . But how could I , it was closed !
There was a lot of work to do but we were happy to do it with happy people and at the end we had the opportunity to take part in the pop concert . It was wonderful !
As my girlfriend lived alone I could have stayed with her or just have gone on travelling around the world . I was thinking a lot about this problem and how to solve it so I needed someone to talk to and Pat had always been my best friend .
In fact , shopping is not always enjoyable because sometimes you want to buy things but you do n't have enough money !
After the show had finished , I went to the theatre restaurant to have something to drink and relax but it was closed because the staff was on holiday .
And finally , after the show , I wanted to have a coffee but the theatre restaurant was closed !
Dear Alice ,
Dear Sir/Madam
In my opinion , there are two possible fashions for the future . If humans change to be more free from social rules , I think that their dress will also be very extreme and unlimited . There will be a variety of colours and fashion styles . Everybody will wear anything he/she likes , choosing clothes from any century they wish without this being strange . On the other hand , if human society changes to become stricter and more limited , there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing , formed by the needs of society . All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule . Perhaps the style of their dress will indicate their position in society too .
Shopping may be enjoyable or not at all !
I look forward to hearing from you .
Second , modern technology makes communication much easier and more enjoyable . With the spreading use of the Internet , people living in different parts of the world can chat with each other via the web . And we can also share important information with other people . The development of information technology has changed the world into `` a global village '' .
In my last letter I promised to write to you about my experience working at a pop-concert . The job came unexpectedly as my friend , who was supposed to work there , broke her leg just two days before the event . So she asked me to fill her position . Even though I had planned something else to do I agreed because she 's my very good friend .
I write you this letter because I want to tell you about my experiences at the festival . I spent two days at the `` International Arts Festival '' and I have to say that it was a good event but I think some details could be better the next time . For example , on the leaflet it was written that there would be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries . That was disappointing ! Some concert halls were really small so that there was bad air and not enough room for everyone and you could not enjoy anything ! What about plays and films ? It was a small offer ; I hope it will be larger the next time .
thank you .
My second task was to look in all the fans ' bags to confiscate `` dangerous '' items . I saw really funny things like toothbrushes in the bags . This part of my work was really funny and I enjoyed it .
I was very nervous because I 'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and I could n't help it and I started crying - you can imagine , they were so handsome that I could n't believe it - I tried to calm down because I had to work , and later I began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very fast - although I was working - and it was like a dream .
On the last day , the students can enjoy a sightseeing tour around the city , which can be arranged if the students want to . The group can also visit the zoo , the opera or stay and relax in the college 's enormous garden and enjoy the scenery .
I am writing to inform you about the bad experience I had yesterday evening going to the theatre .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ? In what way will they change ? Of course nobody knows the answer and maybe we should be happy about that .
I am writing this letter to let you know about the bad points of the theatre .
People all have different opinions about books . Some prefer realistic stories whereas others prefer unusual ones . But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway 's `` The Old Man and the Sea ' .
When Charles told Carlotta what he knew , Carlotta started crying .
I know they are not like us . They are famous , but I think they need to be alone sometimes . They need to be with their family in peace . This is important for everybody and I think this is important for them , too .
A very good aspect of this change is that women have more freedom to work because before we had the technology they had to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave ovens .
The path we were walking on was quite clean and I was feeling really happy and relaxed ... until we reached a river . There was neither a bridge nor a canoe . The only way to cross it was by walking on a big old tree trunk which was lying down , peacefully , making the only bridge between our side and the other .
Thank you .
In spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together . Parents play with their children and have fun . And the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family , they do the same as their parents and have a happy family .
The other day , I worked at a pop concert to help . It was really more interesting than I expected . My job behind the stage was helping with make-up , hair and clothes staylist . It was very hard . The singers often changed their clothes and their make-up was easy to be off because of the sweat . It was different from when I did it at college . There was no time to rest . But I met a lot of famous singers and spoke to them . So many people were in front of the stage and they could n't see them very well , but I was very near to the stage and I could see them just there .
So , you can contact other people with a mobile phone no matter where you are and you can correspond with people in other countries in real time by using the Internet . How incredible it is !
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Madam ,
It does not matter to me whether I stay in a tent or a log cabin , but I would prefer a tent so as to be in closer contact with the wildlife and nature .
OLYMPIC MUSEUM
First of all , about your enquiries , the only time suitable for me to travel is in July . The reason is that my academic year starts in August therefore I need to be here .
I think the people who enjoy shopping are greedy for materialistic things and they have n't any interests in the spirit ( ? ) , in the intellectual life . They are wasting time in their life for nothing . In my opinion we must spend more time on more interesting things than shopping , like sport , reading , chatting about ideas which make our lives better . We must do something to help other people to feel better and be useful .
First of all , it would be suitable for me to travel in July only , because that is when I am on holiday from work .
In conclusion , it was the worst evening I have ever had in my life so I must ask you for my money back .
Dear Sir Brown , I 'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw . I did n't have a good time ! Firstly , Danny Brook did n't act . There was another actor , James Kee , but I did n't like him ! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he was n't there . In addition to that , the show did n't start at 20.15 ; so it ended at 23.45 and I could n't go to a meeting . I 'm very disappointed by all these problems ! Your theatre is very disorganized ! The ticket 's price was £20 and there were n't any discounts ! After the show , I wanted to eat something , but the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was in Italy for a special course . I did n't have great fun , so I ask for that money back . Yours faithfully
First of all , I would like to travel only in July due to my work commitment . I am only allowed to take holiday in July .
I hope this is enough to express my feeling and I hope someday we can share such things together .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
Then , surfing on the Internet is becoming my passion : it 's incredible how many unthinkable activities you can do with it . It 's simply fantastic !
I prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it 's more comfortable . They are warmer and drier and I 'm afraid of insects and spiders .
The vocalist of the Almendegos was by my side and he touched my arm . I will never wash my arm again . After all of this we saw the show from the best place , near the stage and afterwards , the thing that I most liked , we were invited to see the group and got their signatures .
What I particularly liked about this experience was meeting my favourite pop group and talking with them about their lives as members of a pop group . I also enjoyed being able to work as part of a team with both all the members of the club and the BSB . It was one of the best experiences I have had in all my life
Thank you for your letter and congratulations ! I have always been interested in visiting other countries . In fact I did n't want to ask my parents for money , and going on holiday with you is an ideal solution .
Hi ! How are you doing ? I had a wonderful time last month . I helped at a pop concert as a volunteer . My jobs were collecting tickets , selling goods and refreshments , guiding people to the right seat and cleaning up the concert hall after the concert finished . I was n't allowed to help do heavy work , even though I wanted to , because I 'm a woman . What I particularly liked about the experience was the concert was achieved through our support . It seemed that all people , the audience , the band and the staff were delightful . If I have the chance , I want to help at a concert again . I have never felt such satisfaction . I really recommend you to help them , I think this is a good opportunity and I want you to understand my feeling well . I 've got lots of things about the concert to talk to you about . I want to know your opinion .
Pat told me that he was also in love with me . He told me that it was necessary to do something about it . But I did n't know what to do .
People who have their own car , do n't attempt to walk even if it is a short distance .
Dear Sir :
First of all , I would like to travel only in July because I am employed and will be able to finish my contract in June . In August I am going to apply for a new job .
Yours faithfully ,
Yours sincerely
Forgive me for not writing to you sooner . As you know , I was fairly busy with studying for my First Certificate .
You wrote to me that I have a chance to do two activities , which I can choose . I 'm quite good at painting and I play tennis . I 'll be very happy if you can give me a chance to use the camp 's art studio and you 'll be able to prepare some painting materials like oil paints , canvas and brushes for me . The size of the canvas is n't so important .
I asked about the discounts available as we were a group of 15 people , but the answer I was given was that nobody had ever heard of them .
Po Lin Temple is open to the public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Monday to Friday , and 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday .
Thank you very much for the prize . I am writing this letter to inform you that I have received your letters and I am going on the trip .
One night , I heard a strange sound . I looked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine . They went into the house through a window . I thought it was some robbers .
IT 'S UNDENIABLE THAT DURING THIS CENTURY OUR WORLD HAS BEEN CHANGING . NEW INVENTIONS HAVE BEEN INVENTED AND SCIENCE HAS MADE QUICK PROGRESS . AS A RESULT OF THIS PEOPLE 'S DAILY LIVES HAVE BEEN CHANGING AS WELL .
Love
I realised that my bag was outside and I went out to look for it , when a shower of stones covered the entrance of the hole . I was terrified , I knew that the only solution was to ask for help . I walked alone a long distance until I found a telephone . I called the police and they ask for a rescue .
I look forward to hearing from you very soon .
Second , it only started at 20:15 . It was 45 minutes later than it was supposed to be . It was so boring to wait for the show in a noisy and hot theatre .
Hope to hear from you :
You need more explanations from me to understand my motivation at the end of this story . In fact , I did this kind of study because of my interests in programming . The problem is that I ca n't keep calm during an exam .
I 'm a shopaholic , but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable . For instance , I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy . We went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends ' graduation ( besides other reasons ) . They had invited us and we wanted them to see us looking stunningly beautiful .
Secondly , I would rather stay in a tent , because when I was a child I used to go to a campsite and stay in a tent with my family for two weeks every summer and I thoroughly enjoyed it .
Life is really easy . You need to learn how you can use technology . But , sometimes , I miss the old days . I miss playing in the garden , posting a letter to my friends , and forgetting an important day . Sometimes I want to go somewhere without technology .
Dear Kim
Best wishes .

One year later , I was working in Kang-nam police station in Seoul . Suddenly , the burglar alarm came on . So , another policeman and I had to arrive at the accident place quickly . When we arrived at the place where it happened , one man started running away . Without any thought , I ran quickly like a swallow . Then , he tried to go over the wall , I held his leg . He fell down and we had to stare at each other . After we fought for a minute , I was able to arrest him . As a result , I could go on vacation . When I told my mother , she asked me not to do it again .
My name is Bao-yu Liao . I am the representative of our class in your college to write to you .
I want to know what kind of clothes I have to wear there and how much money I will spend . I want to know if I can take my cellular phone , too .
I think this topic is so exciting from the anthropological and psychological point of view , because we can study the subject 's reactions before , during and after shopping .
Every artist could scream at me whenever they wanted . The real thing was that I had to look after them because without me they would have been lost . That was a good feeling for me . I had to tell them when they had to go on stage and what kind of clothes they should wear . I also had to give them drinks and food and help them to relax whenever they were nervous .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Helen :
Last week I went to the Circle theatre , for which you are responsible , to see the musical show `` Over the Rainbow '' . The advertisement outside the theatre described a lot of interesting things to enjoy . I am writing this letter because I have had a very disappointing evening . Everything in the advertisement has been done in the Wrong Way . Firstly there was a different actor in the starring role ; you had written DANNY BROOK and he was absent . I had attended the show because I like DANNY BROOK a lot , but you had changed the programme . Moreover the advertisement said that the time of the show was 19.30 ; on the contrary it started 45 minutes late . Another thing that was wrong is about discounts : you had written they were available , but they were not and so I had to pay the full price . But the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant in the theatre was closed and so I had to go to another place to have dinner .
I 'm a student . My school starts in September and it finishes in June . July is the month when I 'm having a rest and I 'm doing nothing . In August I 'm working in a shop which is my sister 's . If I could go in July that would be grate .
Pusan Castle
Re activities : During the two weeks I would like to do tennis and swimming . I have regularly played tennis since I was nine years old and I have entered several competitions . Swimming is another sport I learned when I was six .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I attach to this letter my two tickets .
Besides all those improvements and comforts I ca n't stop thinking where all this will lead us . I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives , however , I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or have already fallen into wicked hands .
Well , that 's all . I hope one day you get to change what you wanted . I miss you and let 's keep in touch . Bye..
After all the things that I have mentioned it is clear that shopping is not enjoyable .
First of all , I am sorry to say that I can only travel in July . As my family 's new restaurant is about to open in August , I need to help with the restaurant , which is expected to be rather busy .
First of all , the stars of the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . The only reason I bought a ticket was because of Danny Brook and Tina Trulove , as your advertisement had shown . But your stars were not there .
As a result , we came back home in order to eat some fast food .
ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME , ACCOMMODATION PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO . ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION - I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL IN JULY . THE REASON IS I AM WORKING FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY AS A MARKETING SPECIALIST AND WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST TELECOMMUNICATION FAIR IN THE WORLD WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN SEPTEMBER . WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS FOR THE WHOLE OF AUGUST SO THE ONLY ONE VACATION MONTH I CAN GO IS JULY .
I just want to ask you about something else . How many jeans , Pants , sweaters etc ... do I have to take ? And how much money do I need to bring in my pocket ?
As the show is held on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00 we could go there instead of going shopping in the afternoon . This way , we would visit the museum as you had planned and on Wednesday afternoon we could use the free time to do some shopping if we wished .
Thank you for your lovely letter and I hope you are well .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Fashion in 100 years
Dear Helen Ryan ,
In my opinion there should be a rule which lets the media approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home to leave them at least one place to feel safe .
Not only these subjects are studied by us , but also Latin , Russian , Ukrainian , Biology and Physical training , but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects .
By the time I got home , I would be completely exhausted . As you can see , shopping is not always enjoyable .
But this time things had gone too far .
I would like to request some information about accommodation and if you could specify what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money I have to take .
As for the accommodation , I would prefer log cabins . I 'm not the kind of person who can easily fall asleep and it gets worse when I am in a tent .
`` Are you looking for these ? '' asked Philip , showing the keys to the car .
Furthermore , the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us . When there was an intermission we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late . We could n't have a drink . Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give me my money back because in the advertisement there were some things that we did n't have in the theatre .
On the other hand , there are people who think the opposite , such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they hardly ever go shopping - only when they need clothes , or something for their job or school . In that way shopping can be as much fun as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation in the future .
What technology could be out of control ? Since the scientific revolution and the Industrial Revolution , between the 17th and 18th centuries there have been sudden changes in our daily way of life .
12th June 2001
Please , do not hesitate to contact me at the above address if you need any further information .
There is one more thing . When you are a man and your wife asks you to go shopping , be patient ! Because women love shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always give your opinion about clothes , music , perfumes ...
Also , I prefer to stay in a tent because I think it is a good chance for me to live with nature and to wake up hearing birds which are singing . It will be nice !
Dear Ms. Ryan
Finally , I need to know what kind of clothes and how many clothes I should pack . Is there any place where I can wash my clothes ? I also need some information about the money I should take . Do you have any kind of souvenirs that I can buy ? Do I need to take any money at all ?
Last month I had the most exciting experience in my life . As you know , I was helping at the pop concert and it was amazing !
As a result we were grounded for all the holidays and all because of our almost perfect Pat .
Dear Mr. manager of The Circle Theatre :
This is going to take place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 .
All of us know that technology and science have affected our lives . Considering my whole life I can say that modern technology has changed my daily life in many ways .
I received your letter this morning . I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill and is unable to attend the conference ; I am glad that you are able to be the leader of the group . I hope that the information below is very useful to you , during your attendance at the conference .
I used to like shopping , but recently I came across many disadvantages of this activity . Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything they want . It is n't true . Nowadays we have many big shopping centres . We like them because everything is in one place . The most suitable time for shopping is the weekend when parents do n't work and children have n't got school . Because of that , shopping centres are overcrowded . You ca n't buy something in a peaceful and calm atmosphere . In addition , in this kind of shops prices are very high , of course not all of them . However such centres are very useful and necessary . In my opinion the worst thing which may happen is an extremely long queue for the changing room . It is really exhausting . Afterwards you are all in . Nevertheless sometimes shopping can be enjoyable . If you bought something gorgeous , you will be very happy . On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you are in a bad mood do n't go shopping .
However , I would like to know if by any chance the photography activities are only for beginners . In this case I would rather do some climbing , which I have never done before .
Hi Kim !
The two activities that I prefer are Basketball , because I played in my school 's team for almost a year , and Photography , which is a hobby that I am good at and I have done since I was ten .
13th June 2000
Dear Manager : I am Angela Ounis and I am writing to you because I went to see 'Over the Rainbow ' , London 's newest and best musical show . I am very disappointed by this evening 's show . First of all , the stars that were supposed to be there ( Danny Brook and Tina Truelove ) were n't there . I was so enthusiastic about your stars , when I realized they had been replaced , even though the replacements were good , it was n't the same . I arrived there at 19:15 . The show was supposed to start at 19.30 , but started at 20:15 . It can not be possible that a schedule for a show can be changed that much . You go there to see a show and have a good time , not to wait for ever for what you want . Also it was said that Discounts would be available , but I did n't receive any discount as you were cheating us . I know that you have a big responsibility but if you have told something to people , stick to it . Also , the theatre Restaurant was closed because they 've got a problem with the schedule 's organization . That was so unpleasant , people were starving . I am so disappointed with this that I am within my rights to ask for some money back , your theatre show was n't what was expected . Please let me know . sincerely yours
The End .
It may come true in the near future . Our robot maid will do all of the housework instead of a human . In addition to this you will be able to control all parts of the house by computer such as temperature or vacuum cleaning .
Lots of Love
However , journalists should not only think about commercial value , because morality and principles are also concerned . Of course , if everyone paid less attention or interest , the situation would be better . I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana dying in the car crash was one of the most disastrous examples .
. Cashpoints , toilets , emergency services etc are within easy reach .
Now I will give you the information which you asked for . It is only possible for me to travel in July . That is the only month when I have time because after July I have to start at university .
Finally , I would like to ask you what kind of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp , the amount of money that , more or less , I would need to bring with me and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves .
In the last fifty years human technologies have grown exponentially . First the conquest of space , then computers , and now the new biotechnologies have changed , and are changing , the face of the world .
Thank you very much and I look forward to hearing from you .
Dear Kim
Thank you for an unusual event .
Dear Kim !
To sum up , famous people are the same as we are , and we all have the right to lead a private life and no right to intrude on their privacy . Therefore , I strongly believe that famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Secondly the play did n't start at 19:30 as we were told but it started after a delay of 45 minutes . Also when I visited the theatre 's restaurant I found it closed for renovation .
Finally , on the last day you have three hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now . It is up to you .
Last week my son and I went to see Over the rainbow at the Circle theatre . We paid to see Danny Brook , my son 's favourite actor , but we were quite disappointed . My son was very happy because he would see his favourite actor for the first time . However , that 's just the beginning of the problems we had . Expecting British punctuality , we went to the theatre at 19:00 to watch the 19:30 show but it only started at 20:15 . It finished later than it was supposed to and then we missed the train . I did n't see any discounts available ; I thought my son would have paid less than I . As we had already missed the first we went to the theatre restaurant , which is famous for its good food , however , it was closed .
Clothes in the future
yours sincerely
Yesterday I decided to go to the `` blue disco '' because the guy I liked was going to be there . But there was a little problem and it was that my parents did n't let me go to discos alone , so I had to go illegally , and I decided I would do it .
Yours sincerely ,
Bye and think about this .
Yours faithfully
As you already know , we are going to have an end-of-conference party where the Head of the college will give a short speech at the beginning , then there will be a buffet and a disco . You do n't need to dress up smartly but please , make sure that your students do n't wear shorts or trainers .
Dear Matt :

On the other hand , this kind of facility has made our life more comfortable and easier . In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carrying our luggage and shopping bags . Cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journeys . For example , in the past it would had been extremely exhausting to travel on a horse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from .
We have to teach our children the value of money , to explain the difficulties of earning money in a job , because we have to work eight , nine or ten hours a day , for example . Educating the youngest is a first step and helps our society .
I am writing to give you further information about me which you need for Camp California .
Dear readers
Thank you very much for your letter . I 'm very happy to receive some news from you . I 'm going to reply to your question .
If we came back to the past , we felt everything , it was so difficult to do , we would have plane and done by ourselves and last time .
I started to get along with other people and had new friends but I continued telling Pat my secrets . My new friends sometimes talked to me about Pat and they asked me once if we were close friends . I asked them why they had asked me that . Their answer surprised me so much . They told me Pat used to be a close friend of theirs and she used to talk about me and my problems . So , they had already known all my secrets for a long time !
GUSTAV SOARES .
We look forward to hearing from you regarding this matter .
But , Mark , Pat and I were planning a birthday party for Sally on June 2 at her own home . It should have been `` surprising '' . Sally 's husband is now in Singapore on business , so she had to spend her birthday without him . Considering her loneliness , we made every effort to please her and to encourage her ; because she was loved by everybody for her gentle , kind and lovely character . She was not so lucky in her life . Her parents had already died when she was in high school . She has no brothers and sisters . After marriage , Sally and her husband Nigel realized that they would not be able to have children . In spite of such difficulties , she always has a pretty , charming smile for us .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Yours Faithfully ,
SO , I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD REFUND ALL OR PART OF THE MONEY WHICH I PAID FOR THE SHOW .
This story started when I arrived in this town with my family . We came here to build our own house because my father had been fired and we had to sell our house in Buenos Aires . My mother suggested coming here because one of her brothers was established here and he could help us .
When I stay home I can watch TV or listen to the radio etc , so modern technology helps me to spend my free time .
It would be interesting to film a math lesson . As it is very boring , everybody would understand how difficult it is to get good marks in the final examination .
So , I 'm free when I 'm out of school . I 'd like it would be nicer going there .
The second day 's objective was to install the stage lights , loudspeakers and all the otherstuff . This job was quite hard , but we took our time to be not exhausted !
2 . - I have chosen singing and painting as activities , because I love painting , moreover , I am very good at it , and singing because it is one of my talents .
So , why do n't we think more about the future , instead of being upset about how to get some money to pay for the next party ?
Tadeusz Ochman
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets so he told his mother how his brother Jim lost her suit suitcase on the train . Jim 's mum did n't want him to take her suitcase , but he did . So one morning he reached Victoria Station with the suitcase and took the train for the countryside where he had to work . But when he walked out of the station he realised that he had left the suitcase on the train . Then he waited for the next train to London and he caught it . He was worried about his mother 's reaction , but when he arrived he went to the Station Manager 's office and he found it on the table . He was so happy ! All this story was a secret but Pat revealed it to his mother . She was so angry and confused because Jim had n't told her the truth .
Shopping is annoying but also necessary . That is why it is not always enjoyable .
Dear Helen
Conclusion : I do think , however , that modern technology is essential for human beings nowadays . Although the world of computers will develop day by day , I lively hope we ( human beings ) can maintain our way of seeing things .
Write to me soon .
According to your letter , I should tell you when I would like to travel and I think July is the best time for me because I will be on summer vacation so I would not have to miss any classes .
I think I could leave for the camp in July . Because I 'm supposed to attend an English course in Weymouth , England until June and then I 'm going to travel in Europe with my sister who came from my country 4 weeks ago for this trip . We are planning to spend 2 weeks travelling . So I can go to the camp in the middle of July .
I would like to congratulate you on the excellent programme that you have prepared . I think that it is such a good programme , especially because the places that we visit , like the Science Museum , are very interesting .
Our homes will still be the same in terms of the cuisine . It will still be filled with vegetables and meat . This is because people wo n't give up the great taste of food . Although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two .
To finish off , I would like to ask you how much money is needed for my personal shopping expenses and what kind of clothes I should take .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . She was my best friend for several years as a child . But I have n't seen her since we were 10 years old . When were nine years old and were in third grade we had a 'House ' where we used to play all afternoon . In fact it was n't a real house , it was some stones between the trees in the little forest near our house . But we used to call it 'Our House ' . It was a secret place and we had promised each other not to tell anybody about it . Usually we were cooking flower soup , and swapping secrets .
In fact , your musical show was attractive : actors , time , restaurant , discount tickets , and also the title ! I started to be OK with `` Your perfect evening out '' , certain I was not going to be deceived .
Secondly I would prefer sleeping in a log cabin because I would feel much more comfortable . One reason is the cold , and the other is that I can not sleep on the floor because I have problems with my back .
Hello . I 'm Robert and I 'm writing an article about clothes in the future . In my opinion , in a hundred years we 'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays . What will change with clothes will be how comfortable they are and the way they protect us and our bodies from temperature and physical attacks . I think they will cool us in the summer and make us warmer in the winter . Clothes will be more personalized and they 'll make us feel better and more free . Wearing them we 'll be able to dive underwater at high pressure , and we 'll have freedom of movement . Technology will play a part in clothes ' development , scientists will find a way to reduce the weight of clothes and they will become very light and comfortable , so I want to be in the future to enjoy the clothes . I hope I win the trip !
I am writing about the International Arts Festival , which I went to recently . I had a great time there because taking a place the kind of festival in my town is very unusual . I think that the International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful . I was also pleased with the weekend ticket because I tend to go out at the weekend due to my working on the weekdays so that I had time to go and did not have to worry about the ticket price .
report by the group leader
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . Two days ago I thought I could trust Pat because she was not going to tell anybody our secret , our important secret . I wish I had never told her anything .
I have to tell you that this experience was wonderful and in fact I enjoyed it a lot and of course I got to know a lot of people there .
The two activities which I think would be best for me are swimming and sailing . I love the sea , which is why I became interested in those activities when I was ten . Therefore I have a lot of experience in both .
Dear Ms Helen Ryan
Dear Kim
My dissatisfaction became even greater when I realized that there had been a different actor than Danny Brook performing !
I do n't know exactly how I felt . Sometimes I wake up and think it was nothing but a dream . I hope you liked everything I said and I hope you reply as soon as possible .
By the following , I would like to inform you that I attended your new musical show , the name of which is `` Over the rainbow '' , last Saturday evening , 10th June . I 'm writing to you to make a complaint about your advertisement , which I consider a lying advertisement . Let me explain to you why I 'm now so disappointed . I had one week 's holiday in London with my husband for our honeymoon . We had prepared this quite a long time ago , this trip to the capital and saved a lot of money as well .
Yours sincerely ,
But I do n't regret going to that concert . It was wonderful ! You know I love designing clothes , and there I had the chance to make a dream come true .
Firstly , your advertisement said there were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but it had different actors to my disappointment . Secondly , it said the show started at 19:30 , but it was delayed until 20:15 . I had to wait 45 minutes , wasting time .
To make matters worse , your theatre restaurant was closed and one of your assistants said that it was being under construction for the expansion of that place .
I am generally known as an easy-going person and I can remain calm in emergency situations and I am quite reliable too .
M. Brown has booked rooms in the Palace Hotel . This is a first-class hotel . The easiest way to get from the hotel to the conference is by bus . There is a bus stop in front of your hotel . Take the bus in the direction of the centre of town . After four stops , get off the bus . The name of this bus stop is 'Kongresshaus ' . When you get off the bus , the conference is in the building across the road . You ca n't miss it .
Mobile phones are another thing that are making my life much easier . They allow you to talk to other people no matter where you are . This can be very useful when you have a problem that needs an immediate solution .
Competition Organiser
I write this letter because I think there were too many problems concerning your musical show : `` Over the rainbow '' .
Yours sincerely
Believe it or not , our lives are changing and becoming more complicated every day . The reason for all of this is the impressionable introduction of the `` new technologies '' , such as computers , the Internet or WAP technologies .
To put it in a nutshell , I would like to say that technology can be a good thing , but it creates many problems too .
According to your advertisement , it stars DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE , but surprisingly , was performed by a different actor of whom I did n't even know the name . In addition , the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started half an hour later , at 20:15 .
When I 've time I will write to you again ,
Also I would like to ask you some questions . Do I have to bring lots of money ? I mean do I have to pay for the tent ? What about the clothes ? Do I have to bring a lot ? That is all I want to know . Thank you
I like shopping . Some people when they are tired relax by sleeping , reading a book or watching television , but not me . Walking along the crowded streets of my city is my way of relaxing .
As for selecting two activities , basketball and surfing are definitely on my list . I spend one third of my spare time playing basketball . As a result , I have an important position in our local basketball team . Surfing was a new sport to me which I took up recently . It is really fascinating to challenge the waves . I wish I could learn to be better so that I could enjoy it more in the future .
I am so pleased that I have won the first prize in your competition .
Dear Kim ,
Dear manager I am writing to you because of your new musical show `` Over The Rainbow '' . I spent my holiday in London recently and , it is like a tradition , we went to a musical . After reading your programme I was very impressed and I was looking forward to seeing it . But firstly when we bought our tickets , we did n't get any discount , we had to pay the full price . And then the show started at 20:15 p.m. , although it was supposed to start at 19:30 p.m. , so we had to wait quite long in that crowded room . And when the show finally started , I realized that it was not Danny Brook acting , instead there was an unknown , not very talented actor . After the show we wanted to go to your theatre restaurant , because we were very hungry , but then we saw that it was closed , because of staff illness . I would like to ask you to give us our money back , because it was a very disappointing evening for us . Yours sincerely , Sara Schmidt
I had a really nice time with them even though I would 've preferred to stay at the front with the other people , but anyway it was a great experience for me , I hope to be able to help them next year .
I look forwards to hearing from you
There is a party on the last day of the conference . Special awards will be given to the students whose reports are the best . Less of the party is likely to be as our nightclub so a lot of music , dancing and fun are provided . Please note that alcoholic drinks are only sold until 11pm . You can wear whatever you like for this kind of party .
The end-of-conference party is to be held in the 'Royal Room ' of the hotel , which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness . Therefore , all the guests will be asked to wear the appropriate clothes in order to be accepted .
We stayed at my aunt 's house which was in the centre of the village . In front of my aunt 's house , there was a house with a swimming pool , garage and garden . My aunt told me it was a famous French singer 's house .
At first , I applied to be a volunteer at the pop concert and then I got responsibility for controlling the audience . I had to make the fans keep in a queue . I also helped them find their seats . It was very hard work . For example , I always spoke loudly and ran fast .
My life has been changed by technological advances . Nowadays , we have so many technological things . For instance , TV , computers , telephones , air conditioners . These things are very convenient ; on the other hand , there are lots of disadvantages .
It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has become a necessary condition in some professional activities . Trades , politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs . However , the average man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes when in the hands of a high-school student .
I would be very grateful if your could return to me half or some of my money , or even make the corresponding discount .
I 'm looking forward to receiving your next letter soon .
Secondly , I bought a second musical show ticket which started at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 . As a result , I had to wait over one hour as I arrived there at 19:00 .
My tasks were very specific . I had to help with the layout of the stage , which was very complicated , because there are so many cables , and weir and things going on at the same time . After that part was fully functioning I moved on to work backstage .
Mankind has always been seeking different things . We are learning a lot of things about life and we are practising these things . In the future life will be more artificial than it was .
To conclude , will you kindly let me know if I need some money and what sort of clothes I should bring with me .
AUTHORITIES OF THE CIRCLE THEATRE :
Thank you very much for the prize .
If you would like more information do not hesitate to contact me .
I am a member of the council team so I decided to help them at a pop concert that was organized last month . I helped them to prepare the room for the bands and I decorated the place for the singers . Also , I helped them to choose the right instruments and to test them . It took a long time to test the speakers and the microphones . Apart from this preparation , I also helped out during the concert . I helped them to the music and the songs . It was quite a difficult job but I got some very good experience . I realised it when the concert had finished . The audience was excited and I can not describe my happiness . It was something that I did n't expect . Also , it was the first time in my life . I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were accompanying our songs . I enjoyed it very much and I want to convey my pleasure to you through this letter .
Yours Sincerely ,
Recently I had a week 's holiday in London . During my stay I went to The Circle Theatre to see `` Over the rainbow '' , `` London 's newest and best musical show . '' I have to admit that this was my great mistake . Never before had I had such a disappointing evening .
I would like to travel in July because I will be on my school vacation , so I would not miss my classes .
Dear Ms Ryan ,
Two days before the event Carol , Albert , Sam and me went to visit Pat in her house and she invited us to stay for dinner . We were having a wonderful time chatting and laughing but suddenly the phone rang and Pat answered it . It was her aunt , inviting her over for the weekend so Pat said very loudly : `` I 'm sorry but I have to go to Sam 's flat and decorate it ; it 's a surprise , do n't tell anybody ''
Unable to keep a secret he told everyone , ended his friendship with Ted . Now Ted is rejected by everyone , no one talks to him and Pat is the example , but without his best friend and his honesty .
Let 's have a surprise .
I think I ca n't forgotten this experience on my mind
Finally I would like you to tell me if I should take some special clothes and also what sum of money I will need ... during my vacation .
I am only available in July because I am studying at an engineering school and I 'll work until the end of June . But no problem for July !
SECONDLY , WE CA N'T FORGET EITHER THAT ALL OF US HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE BY MOBILE PHONE , BY THE INTERNET , WHO LIVE NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY , BUT ALSO ABROAD .
Yours Faithfully ,
First of all , I would like to thank you for doing such a good job organising the competition which I luckily won . I have been really very impressed .
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and lessons should be filmed for a short video . In order to write the report I interviewed about one hundred students who are studying in our English class .
I would like to come in July because I work for a big company where you have to take your holiday in that month .
We are concerned that this is a great and the unique opportunity for us to see this show , as it takes place only once a year and only in London . Certainly , we do not refuse to take part in other activities in London . Probably , you will agree to put the London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of the Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday .
I hope your questions have been answered appropriately .
Regarding starting time and the theatre restaurant , to see the musical I had to wait about 45 minutes because it started at 20:15 . As well as this , after seeing the musical I went to the theatre restaurant , which you referred to in your advertisement , but it was closed already . I was really angry !
To sum up , I would like to add that this house is the most famous in our city . You should come and visit it for the paintings or for the building itself .
Looking forward to receiving your prompt reply .
I also have some enquiries concerning the trip . I would like to know what the weather is like at that time of the year so I am able to pack the essential clothing . I would appreciate it if you also advised me on how much money I should take . It is all new for me as I have never been to the USA before .
Despite the fact that I like to go to nice clothes shops I usually return home with nothing in my hands , as prices are usually too high , unfortunately , and out of my price range .
Attitudes to the video about life at our school
Thank you in advance for your help . I look forward to receiving your prompt reply .
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping at last month ? I must say that was great fun . I 'd never had this kind of experience before . Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets . They were lists of pop bands and groups which would appear in the concert in order , and some information about their performance and backgrounds . After that , I had to help people who had a ticket but could n't find their seat . During the concert , I did n't have a lot to do , so I had a chance to see most of the performance . That was excellent . I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars . During the break time I did give a lot of directions to people who could n't find the toilet , and gave people information such as where they could have a cup of coffee . That was a bit boring , but it was part of my job .
For me , the best moments for the shopping are two opposite situations .
Finally , in my opinion , you should visit the Art Gallery . It will take you two or three hours but it 's a gorgeous place . I look forward to hearing from you .
The other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when I asked about it , there were none .
Also , a lot of people were enitieising about the facilities , which were said to be serve in the advertisement . For example , the discount for the tickets was not available , and in particular a lot of people were disappointed that they could n't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed , due to the cleaner forgetting to clean up the mess from the previous party .
Activities connected with the social programme , such as international evenings , sing-along parties and indoor games .
Lastly , I do n't think that it was my perfect evening . I would like to get my money back .
The next day Pat told me that he wanted to be admired by some girls and so he had to tell them our secret .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
At the same time you are enjoying the castle you can take a break to go to the beach and you can look at the castle from the sea . That is also amazing . Also , there is a museum of history inside . As you will see , you have to visit the castle . You wo n't feel regret about that .
I will definitely go to the festival next year , too . To make it more enjoyable , I would be grateful if you could welcome my comments about it .
On balance I think that technology evidently has got more advantages than disadvantages .
I look forward to hearing from you .

One day before an exam , we were so excited and frightened because we were n't ready for the exam . We knew that our teacher kept the exam papers in her desk . One of my friends came up with the idea that we had to steal them . The question was who would be the person to perform this action so we tossed a coin , and the result was me . I was so scared and frightened because if I was caught I would be punished .
Actually this was because most things I saw were different from what the advertisement said .
Secondly , thanks to technology , there are many ways of travelling today . We produce cars , trains and planes which are better and better .
I look forward to hearing from you soon
Those are all my questions . I am looking forward to receiving your reply . Please write to me soon .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
But what I imagine is that these flats 'll have many functions such as offices , leisure centre , shopping centre even school . Because we are living a computerised life , we 'll able to do most things at home or these flats 'll have these places as well .
Firstly , I 'm writing to thank you for the great opportunity you are giving us , especially in planning all this programme in such an accurate way . I think that this programme is well-organised , as you know , because we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points . But I was wondering , as a student of this college , if we could change part of this programme ... we 'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show . It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock . In this way , we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and then we can go to the show .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
Nowadays , everyone has a mobile phone . I am fifteen years old and everybody in my year has got a mobile phone . Five years ago you would n't have even thought about it . It has been a plus for me . For example , now my parents allow me to go to more places just because I have my mobile with me , and , sending text messages is an addiction which every teenager is obsessed with .
Hello Kim ,
Second , I used to go to Camps where they only used log cabins so I prefer , if it is possible , to be in a tent , because it would be a new experience for me .
But not everything about shopping is enjoyable . For example , I hate it when I get into a shopping centre and it is crowded . I do n't like it when I have to try on different sizes because the small size does n't fit me because I have put on weight . It is at this moment when really I realise I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling .
Finally , I think that everybody knows that electricity is a very important invention and for me it is the best .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
In the first place , some housewives do n't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second . To make matters worse , you realise you have forgotten to buy something when you get back home . It is very frustrating . Moreover , if you go with your children , you will have to control them and remember things on your list at the same time and sometimes they cry when they want something in the supermarket . It is a tough chore !
Yours sincerely .
So he decided to scare the old woman away from school . Now he thought it was stupid to tell Jon about it , as he was the best friend of Pat . `` Oh , that girl will cause some problems '' - he thought when Miss Colston entered the classroom . She approached the desk and wanted to open it , but suddenly Pat shouted - `` Miss Colston , please , do n't do that . There 's a frog '' . The teacher stared at the whole class and calmly whispered - `` Who did it ? ''

To sum up , modern technology changed our daily life . Mine too . I do n't think I could live a normal life without these inventions . They are like the air I breathe . I am asking myself - am I a sick man ?
After the conference , there is a party in the same hotel . At this party , there will be some food , soft drinks , music and a special place for dancing . This party is for the students so the clothes wo n't be so formal .
The topical class is similar to speaking and listening but the materials are more up to date . The teacher uses video and pictures to teach students about festivals , sports , museums , etc . It is popular with the students .
I wish you had been there with me helping at a pop concert . I just loved it . I was working with this music system . You know how good I am at musicAnyway I was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds . At the beginning I was connecting all these wires into speakers , music system , guitars etc ... The bit that I particularly liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar - you know how much I love playing guitar - and all these video cameras were just filming us . I asked one of the cameramen when they 're going to show this show on tv , and he told me they 're going to show it on the 10 of June , so turn on your tv on this date , channel three , and you will see me there playing this guitar . AH , it was lovely . These singers are going to come next year so I want to invite you to my house for one or two weeks to see this pop concert . Believe me , you 'll love it and you might play the drums . I told them that you 're really good on drums so they want to try you too .

I look forward to receiving a reply from you .
Thank you very much for your letter , which I just got last week . How are you ? I hope you are having a nice summer now . I wondered who had told you that I helped at a pop concert last month . Anyway , it does n't matter now who told you , but I was very happy and enjoyed it . Well , I am going to tell you about it .
During the day I helped prepare her room , then she arrived , and I was there to continue helping .
As you know , we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle , and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discover this aspect of your country !

The stars and artists are from only six countries , and some concerts take place in small halls . I think you should put that in the advertisement . Are there going to be more plays and films next year ?
Yours sincerely ,
First of all , I have to say that the advertisement promised something totally different from what I saw there . For example , the actors that were announced as taking part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , the discounts were not available and , the principal point : it started forty-five minutes late . Then , to complete this terrible night , the restaurant was closed . I wonder if you could explain to me why .
Dear Sir ,
Sincerely :
Also I could n't visit the theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed for the holidays .
Dear Helen Ryan :
Yours faithfully ,
Afterwards we wanted to go for a pleasant dinner . To our surprise the restaurant was closed because of a lack of staff to keep it open .
yours sincerely
Well , I think you will be happy if I tell you something about this book . I read it two months ago and I liked it very much . It 's a sad story but it lets you know about a type of life that you ca n't imagine really exists . The old man is a sad person but he loves his life and lives on the beach because he ca n't go without seeing the sea for a day .

Conclusion

I think if the journalists want to publish the politicians ' and film stars ' private lives , they should ask for permission . They deserve to have a private life like everybody else .
Shopping is something made , which do not need to be enjoyable . We can analyze when shopping is enjoyable , and when it is not .
The party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college so the best way to get there is to walk . You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes but in my opinion you can wear very casual clothes .
Lessons attended in the language laboratory .
I am looking forward to this holiday .
I 'll choose to stay in a tent , considering that I want to feel the country in a more raw way . And being a photographer during my spare time and a swimmer since I was a child , these will be the activities I 'd like to do while at the camp - I think I am fairly good at doing both things !
First of all , I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook but , actually , it did not star Danny Brook but another person .
The conference will start at 7 p.m. , the same day we expect , the 18th of June . Our director will make a speech afterwards and there will be a party with some snacks , drinks and music . For the people who are interested in it , there will also be karaoke .
Suddenly someone broke my window . I had no time to think . I grabbed one of the pots and hit him on his head . One moment later I called the police .
My name is Agripina T. I just received your letter and I would like to answer and ask some questions . I would like to travel only in July because it 's the only month when I 'm free . In June I have to take some English lessons . I would prefer to stay in log cabins because I think they are more comfortable than tents . I do n't really like staying in tents . If it 's possible to stay in log cabins I 'll be pleased . While I 'm at the Camp , I would like to do two of my favourite activities , which are basketball and singing . I love to play basketball . I 'm not good at it but I try my best . In the past I was in a basketball team and I enjoyed it a lot . Also I like singing . In future I would like to be a singer . I like this kind of activity . There is something else I would like to ask . At the Camp , is there a free uniform or will we have to wear something special ? Also I would like to ask about money . How much money should I take with me ? And is it necessary to bring money , will we need it ?

Yours faithfully ,
Dear Mr. Ryan :
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
First of all , the actor was not Danny Brook .
Actually , I think it was right to tell the teachers but not in Pat 's way . It would have been better for both Pat and Jan if they had told the teachers privately and secretly because Tim would n't have known who had told the teachers .
Yours sincerely ,
Love
First of all , shopping can be a good thing if it is a chance to forget about all the problems you have , even if it is just for a moment . It relieves you from the pressure of life while you are looking for something to buy .
I would like to travel to Camp California only in July because during June I am very busy with my exams . I will take the F.C.E at the University of Cambridge and other exams in several subjects at my high school .
I have one question to ask you . I have a little brother and I want to know if I could take him with me . He does n't like to stay at home alone .
Thirdly , regarding the activities I have to choose , I would prefer swimming and tennis . I have gained some experience in playing tennis due to the tennis court that we used to have at home . I do a lot of sports , so apart from playing tennis I am a member of our local swimming centre . I can assure you that I am gradually improving my sports skills .
The concert was in the university in the middle of the field and at the beginning when we arrived there were n't many people , only those who had to prepare the stage and the sound system and of course us , who had the job of serving drinks during the concert .

Do n't miss the chance to visit the historical museum , located in the heart of the capital city . A traditional building which was built at the beginning of the century , the historical museum is simply a symbol , a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle : their freedom . There are five different floors , each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history , starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967 . The museum provides the visitor with the opportunity to see original pieces of writing , famous paintings having as their main subject the revolution of 1821 , and aspects of the Greek religion that have always been considered to be a vital part of Greek history . There is a small entry fee . Inside the museum there is a bookshop with a large variety of historical books , maps etc .
In addition , everything is now so expensive that you have to compare the prices . You have to find which shop offers you good quality products for a good price . Sometimes some goods are expensive but of a very bad quality . And it is not an easy task if you have to complain about the quality . Most of the time the shop assistant does n't believe you .
I was really pleased to receive your letter . Unfortunately Richard Brown is ill but I can help you as much as I can . So , I 'm writing to reply to give all the information you asked for .
Yours Faithfully ,
I would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports I have never tried before . That means I do not have any experience .
Thank you very much for your letter . I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions !
Finally , I would like to know some news about you . What have you done ? Are you studying a lot ?
Pat sent a fax to my house with the different alternatives she had thought of but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the surprise was ruined . But the party was great after all .
I hate shopping but on the other hand sometimes you can have fun doing it . In my opinion , it depends on your mood , your financial situation , of course , where you are going to go shopping and what you are going to buy .
Give my love to your family
How has modern technology changed my daily life ? I think that technology has changed my life and everybody 's life in many ways . Nowadays , technology is everywhere , all over your house , your school , office or any place you can be in a city . This technology has helped to make my life easier and more exciting , but like everything it has had some negative aspects .
Moreover , as I had read the advertisement carefully , I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the theatre 's restaurant . But , to our surprise , it was closed . At the end of all these circumstances , we were so puzzled and disappointed that we decided to make a complaint .

Let me know if he likes it or not and I hope we 'll be able to get together before too long .
Have you ever imagined how this world would be if there was no electric light ? It must have made a big impact on industry , agriculture and our lifestyle . Think about when the electricity in your house got short circuited . Did you feel uncomfortable ? Could you do anything much without light ?
I think that showing their beauty is one of animals ' basic instincts . I could n't stand wearing a suit or kit like that which has been shown in Starwars !
Dear Ms. Ryan ,
Last week I spent my holiday in London and I saw your musical `` Over the rainbow ' in the Circle Theatre and I was really disappointed . When I read the advertisement for the show I was really excited but after the show I was not very happy because of the following problems .
He had a puncture and he did n't know how to repair it . Then I changed the tyre and during this time he was asking me about my hobbies , studies , everything . He was really kind and friendly but really what I really enjoyed most about it was when he invited me out that night for a drink at the most luxurious pub I have ever been to . Can you believe my luck ?
I would like to suggest a change in the programme by giving up shopping and going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
I have never been to California . How is the weather there in July ? What kind of clothes would you recommend taking with me ? Is it possible to pay by credit card or should I take travellers ' cheques ?
For accommodation at Camp California I prefer tents , because I used to stay in tents when on holiday . I like it .
Jae Hwa . Kim .
I would like to travel in July this year because I think the weather will be nice and I can take a holiday . I would like to use a tent for my accommodation . I think it is more interesting than a log cabin . I can be closer to nature and I have never used tents before . It seems to be exciting .
It was dangerous , but I had to do it . I did not have any choice since my brother was in trouble . I had to become a burglar again and steal jewellery from the jewellers nearby .
I refer to your advertisement in the Herald Tribune where you advertised the Circle Theatre and the recent musical : Over the Rainbow .
We are looking forward to hearing from you .
Dear Jane Clark ,
Dear Sir : I am writing this letter to you because I would like you to know about a musical show which I went to see at the Circle Theatre . First of all , I wanted to see this musical 'Over the Rainbow ' because the actor Danny Brook was acting in it . But when the musical started I became very disappointed because Harry Smythe , a not very famous actor , was acting instead of Danny Brook . Then , the musical did n't start on time . It was supposed to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour . All the people got very angry . Also I bought a £20 ticket because the advertisement for the show said that discounts were available for £10 £15 , £20 tickets . I could n't have my ticket discounted because when I went to buy it they told me that was untrue . Furthermore , the advertisement said that the theatre restaurant was open but when we went there after the show , it was closed because the the restaurant chef was ill . It was ridiculous ! In conclusion , I did n't have my perfect evening out , in other words , I had a very disappointing evening so I am asking you for my money back . I would like to have my money back in ten days , otherwise , I will have to sue you . I am looking forward to hearing from you . Yours sincerely ,
Yours sincerely ,
In order to write this report , I spent hours in this wonderful museum . There , I saw the exhibitions and admired the building itself . I walked around the garden too .
I would like to go to `` Camp California '' in July because I will have to produce `` Mission Impossible III '' from August . I will be busy deciding everything about this film and will not have enough time to go there .
I hope you will not be angry if I give you some advice . First , I would like to talk about your section `` Stars and Artists '' . This section is really great and attracts a lot of people . From my point of view , it will better if you have some `` Stars and Artists '' from only six countries because the spectators will probably be more interested in your festival if they know the celebrities .
But the play started forty-five minutes late , and the star of the show , of whom I 'm a great fan an who was the main reason for why I decided to see the play , had been changed for another actor , who turned out to be really bad .
Finally , about the three free hours , my personal preference is to go shopping . Our city has got the biggest shopping centre in South England . There are so many shops . It is worth spending time and money on that .
Third , I love playing basketball . I am a great player and I play for my University and I like to be playing all the time so I will not miss this activity . The other activity would be surfing . I think it is very cool and I want to learn .
First of all I would like to say that modern technology has changed my daily life very much .
Ivan . S .
The plays and films were a great success and I would like to ask if there will be more next year because in my opinion people would appreciate it .
If you need further information do not hesitate to contact us .
I am writing in reply to your letter , which I received last week , and in fact I am very surprised and pleased with the prize .

And what about mobile telephones ? Changes wo n't stop coming : the WAP technology ( you 'll buy a cake from a vending machine without any coins , only one call ) , digital TV , virtual reality and more ...
Shopping , what an exciting thing !
My name is Manuel Olmez and last week I went to see the musical show 'Over the rainbow ' at the Circle theatre .
To sum up , I am very disappointed about the musical in your theatre . Neither the beautiful surroundings near your theatre nor the comfortable seats compensated for my horrible evening . Therefore , I would like you to send my money back , because I think I deserve it as a member of the audience . I look forward to hearing from you .
On top of everything the ticket office did n't offer any discounts , so on the last day I could n't buy a present for my neighbour .
Dear Sir/Madam
Yours truly ,
In today 's fast-moving world young people spend less and less time cooking or eating healthy food . When they are at home , especially children , parents take care of them and always prepare a good dinner with meat or a fresh salad for supper .
I would like to travel in July because I will be working for the rest of the summer . I would like to stay in a log cabin , since I ca n't sleep in tiny , narrow areas . I have been sailing in the Mediterennean for eight years and I have been playing tennis for four years so I would like to choose sailing and tennis as activities .
I was shocked because I had already spoken with them and I had got two autographs .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I must say that being at a concert is very nice . But helping at a concert is much nicer . At the end I realized that all you need is co-operation and you must n't think selfishly . Hope to hear from you soon .
I am writing this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday . I do welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving the information that you have asked me for .
I was promised that the star was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw another star that was completely different from your brochure . To make the matter worse , I had travelled to London to see this famous star but I did n't see any shows with him . It makes me a bit angry .
With best wishes , yours
Finally , you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historic places ( castles built in the 13th century ) or art galleries , as well as the beautiful Bodnant Garden .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
I would like to answer your questions . Please note that I can travel only in July because only then can I take holidays from my work , after the busy time in the months of May and June .
Thank you very much for your letter , which informed me that I have won the first prize of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A . Here is some information as requested .
When it 's very cold in winter , we just wear light clothes what we want , in our style . Because special warm and healthy material will be developed and used inside thin clothes so we do n't need to put heavy clothes on our bodies . We can show our figure in winter as well .
First of all , I would like to travel in July , because , during the other months , I will be studying , preparing myself for exams or I will be away travelling somewhere else with my relatives .
There is also one thing that I would like to ask you about . The question is : Do I need some extra money and what kind of clothes should I take for this trip ?
Thirdly , we will have the end-of-conference party at 6 p.m. You can have dinner with wine which is very famous in our area and also you can enjoy the semi-classical concert which we have been preparing for 3 months . But I hope you will wear a formal suit and dress . You will not be allowed to enter this party unless you wear casual clothes . Lastly , you will not have any problem spending your extra time in Cambridge because we have a lot of attractions . Cambridge bus tour , for example , will be very nice for you because it is the best and the easiest way of getting to know Cambridge . But if you do not like it , you can enjoy the City centre with a walking tour and then you can enjoy going punting which is the most pleasant attraction in Cambridge .
Finally , you would like to know about some activities for three hours of free time . I think you can go to the 'Dreamland ' . In this place there are video games , some little competitions and a small zoo available . Students can enjoy their time in this place and it is on the way to the airport .
And also I want to ask some questions . What clothes should I take ? How much money should I take ? And how can we meet at the airport ? I am looking forward to your reply .
Considering the advertisement , which appeared in one of London 's newspapers , I would like to present you with some of my complaints about your musical spectacle . Firstly , I would like to say that the cast , which you `` advertised '' , has been changed . The man who played the main male role was not the one who was mentioned in the advertisement . Secondly , the time when your musical should start was changed , delaying your show for nearly one hour ! In your advertisement I noticed some information about discounts which were supposed to be available - no , they were not ! Another `` defect '' in the advertisement was an `` invitation '' to the restaurant after the show . For unknown reasons , I found the restaurant closed ( there was no information giving a reason for closing it ) . Finally , you guaranteed `` a perfect evening out '' , but for me it was the worst visit to the theatre in two years .
As a second point , the actor was not Danny Brook , as advertised , but someone else I 've never heard of before . His acting and singing were horrible .
One of the most important aims of the media is to inform people about famous people such as politicians , films stars or successful musicians . In order to fulfil their readers ' requirements they constantly follow them . This kind of people are known as paparazzi .
The most important development is the Internet , which is connected to the whole world 's computers by telephone lines . You can send a letter to your friend by e-mail instead of writing it on a piece of paper and sending it by post . It just takes you a few minutes . How convenient it is ! There are also many more advantages . You can buy something in a supermarket by only a mail order . You do n't need to leave your home .
Who would talk now about enjoyable shopping trips ? I 'm sure there would be plenty of people ready to do it .
But there is still another point : the theatre restaurant where I had decided to have supper was closed , without anyone giving the reason . I had to go back to the hotel , because all the restaurants in the area were completely crowded .
Every day , something changes and we become more modern . Companies use computers instead of books , dentists use modernized electric tools instead of just a pair of pliers . Even homes are affected . From letters to emails , from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves . But we are n't just going to stop here are we ? No , in the future , the present will be the past and those things now new to us will be old , outdated and changed .
. What kind of chosen do I have to take
I would be grateful if you could tell me what kind of clothes I have to take with me and how much money , more or less , you think I should take .
I can not imagine how our life would be . We live in a busy world . In the business world you use the phone all the time to speak with your clients , to make appointments , to order an article etc . ; so , time is money !
Dear Jean Clark ,
My job was to accommodate to the people of the main sit of the theatre . Of course those places were reserved just for well-known people who wanted to help by attending the concert .
First of all , and the most important for me , is that you lie to your audience . I did n't see Danny Brook anywhere , but another actor . That was a big mistake . Unfortunately your advertisement said that the show starts at 19:30 but it started 45 minutes later . Also there were n't any discounts .
I 'd like to ask for a full refund for this awful night . Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible ?
I 've to relax to this to you very well .
