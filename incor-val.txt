The first , you have changed the actor .
Dear Helen Ryan .
I would prefer long cabins and I hope that then I will have enough place for all the things I will carry with me .
I 'm looking forward to receiving your decision .
I went to the Circle Theatre yesterday , to see the play `` Over The Rainbow '' and I must say that I got rather disappointed .
Yours sincerely
Your faightfully
I really hope to see you soon .
I am looking forward to seeing you all soon .
I 'm not dare to culculate how much I have spent for those things without thinking . However , it was not bad , my mom always told me that I had n't have earned enough money so that I should n't have spent it in the wrong way .
However it was one persone wich he told me , it was n't happy at all with the phone , because he used to writte a lot , especially at Christmas to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phone him losing a very old fashion .
on the other hand , there 're some ways that remain the same . The toilet should remain the same as people need to use daily and nothing can replace it . Second , there should be friends and family members in the home to provide joyful and fun . Since friends and family members wo n't change and replace , by anything .
Yours sincerely ,
Secondly , the musical was not started on time . It was going to start 19.30 . However , It was started 45 minutes later . Afterall , I lost my find return train after show .
In the afternoon I was sitting around , waiting for the pop groups . Then at five o'clock my favourite band `` Tristania '' arrived .
Thank you for the programme you have organised for our visit to London . We think it will be a very interesting trip , especially the sightseeing by bus .
I was starting to sell the tickets when a person who organised told me to go into the lodge . They needed one person for putting the clothes into a wardrobe . It was the lodge of Mylene Farmer . Are you thinking ? I was so exciting ! Unfortunately , I did n't see her but it allowed me to talk with her manager John and her musicians . All were very kindly and pleasant . It was a big moment for me . Finally these people are like us , they have just a special job with special times . The next year , if it will be possible , I would like go back with you . They will organise a same concert pop but with an other singer . I look forward to hearing from you soon .
It seems to me that all these failures were your falt , because you were responsible for the arrangement of the show . I think you ought to have postponed the show and have reimbursed me a ticket price . However , conserning that I saw the show , I would like to get a half refund .
In my opinion , clothes will not change so much , because fashion is an eternal cycle . You will find always basic clothes , but I think that it will be the materials which will change .
What should be filmed .
For many years scientific and technological break throughs have changed our lives . I think that the more technological developments we have the more comfortable lives we enjoy . Amaisingly , we can find that computer users are getting more and more . So the life is much faster and more convenient than before .
I am writing to you to complaint about the problem that happened in the play called `` Over the rainbow '' , and for this reason I would like to get some money back .
At one o'clock I had a break . At this time I promised that I would never do this awful job again . The food was deligious and fortunately I do not had to pay for it .
As a result , journalists should respect their life and always write real news .
Rod was arrested that day and was sent to prison . He then was killed by the other man who escaped that day and was caught soon afterwards .
At the begining I would like to thank you . Now I am going to give you some further informations I would like to travel only in July because I am a student in High school and this is most important year of my life I am studying to university entrance exams and I have to study until the end of June and then by the end of June I will be having university entrance exam after that in July I am going to be alright .
I hope that you will find this composition interesting .
The 70 % of students said that the acting lesson should be filmed as the students , attending this lesson , are not only excited but also very active . Additionally , 15 % of students answered they want the presentation lesson to be filmed . The reason why they choose this lesson is that every student in their turn of presentation does his or her best .
And if this is a problem to me , imagine how bad a very fat woman ( or man ) should feel .
I wish we had never chosen your show . In fact , only after having going into the theatre , I realized that the advertisement I had read was probably about another show .
There will be the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear . In addition we will have the possibility to see the newest make up and hairstyles .
Best wishes .
With the help of some modern technology our daily life would not so difficult .
Yours Faithfully
Inventions have affected all our lives
So all the fashion industry will work to make clothes more useful , practical and comfortable . What will we have ? Breathing jackets and shirts with air conditioning .
The technologi is good as long as it gives people more free time , but what would happened if freetime became your life ?
YOURS FAITHFULLY ,
I look forward to receiving your reply
SECOND I GOT TO THE THEATRE AT 19.20 BECAUSE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT IT CLEARLY APPEARS THAT THE SHOW STARTS AT 19.30 , AND I GOT HEAVILY MAD WHEN I LOOK MY WATCH AND NOTICE THAT I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 40 ( FORTY ) MINUTES AND THE SHOW DID N'T START YET ... I MEAN I WAS AMAIZING !
Love from ,
My wife and I had decided to eat at the theatre restaurant after the play . It turned to be impossible : the restaurant was closed and we did n't even received an explaination therefor .
Yours faithfully ,
Thank you a lot for your letter , I am very happy of having won the competition . I have several precisions to tell you and some questions about the camp .
Of course , shopping is not always so unpleasant , but sometimes it is simply better to stay at home .
Dear Ms Ryan ,
She did not know when she can speak or not speak . We so worry about her in the future . She has not a lot of friend because of this point .
The clothes will be more comfortable but less decorations . People will put on fitted-suit such as diving suit . or perhaps nothing to wear . For instance , people would not care about what other people see . Or maybe we will not need to meet each other no longer .
I played Basketball at school for about two years . I am rather good in it . I also had Painting as main subject at school for five years . I like painting very much , and I think I am good in Painting . I paint a lot in my free time . I prefer painting landscapes and fantasy-pictures .
On top of this we intend to go to the theatre restaurant which was closed because of building activities .
Dear Sir ,
If I found somenthing special to visit in three hours I call you .
However , shopping is entertaining if you do n't know what to do . You can discover a lot of things if you are abroad and learn a lot about the life of local people . Moreover , it is pleasant to try many clothes and to see what you look like in various clothes , especially if you are in a foreign country . It can be funny !
Dear Sir or Mam ,
I would be grateful if you could let me know the above information as soon as possible . Thank you once again for giving me good news !
On the other hand , people tend to wear natural clothes today , made of cotton , wool . This tendency may result in turning down synthetics at all .
I just receive your letter with the good news . I am very happy for winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go but I can only travel on July because I have to work until the end of June .
After hard work we want to go home to have our corner where we are all able to rest and relax .
Dear Sir/Madam
Dear Kim ,
I should not forget mobile phones . If I feel like talking to a friend I just have to call him and whereever he is I will be able to get through to him . Several european companies like Nokia or Ericsson are focusing on mobiles and I have been told that in a couple of years it will be possible to send and e-mail either from the computer or from the mobile which is going to be great .
I 'm waiting forward to hearing from you soon .
As you know , I was there to help for the good running of the concert and there was a lot of different things to do .
The outside lights were broken down and I could n't see anything .
Owing to the bad organisation of the last play that was played in your theatre those last weeks I want to explain you some incorrect information that I found in your advertisement and as a result of it , all the problems that I had .
Faithfully ,
Dear sir ,
For me , I think people 's home may not be built on the ground . The home will be built on the sky - so as to save more land to build the other buildings . As the home is built on the sky . It will save a lot of electricity as solar energy is used .
Dear ...
To : The Principal of Westminster College , Mr Robertson .
In the first I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do so in a hurry or for duty . If you have to run from one shop to another and always looking at the watch , doing shopping is a terrible activity .
Thirsthly , I would prefer to swimming and playing tennis , because I have been practising them since I was I child , and I think I very good in each other .
Look forward to hearing from you soon .
To begin with , I 'd like to underline how the place of technology has increased since a couple of years . With the end of the Second world war and the economic prosperity many goods like TV , washing-machine , etc . became cheaper and available . Nowadays , the Internet and the mobile phone with the developpment of satellite seem to take the lead . Do they affect my daily life ?
Reaching the island , he and his friends fought bravely against the devils . They finally succeeded n defeating the devils , and took back all the money and treasures . After that , they went home .
I want to ask you about money . How much money I need and if I have to have them in cash or I can use a credit card . Could you let me know about the weather because I do n't know what kind of clothes I should take . Would you send me your answer as fast as it possible . I look forward to seeing you soon . Thank you
For the class
Modern technology have change my daily life in many aspects .
Moreover , the musical show was said to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:15 .
I 'm looking forward to getting your letter soon .
Your Sinccerly
Music is traditional lesson in our school , everyone in our school can play at least one instruments , so music lesson should be film and to express music is one of our school daily life style .
I look forward to meeting you on the conference .
Love ,
Dear Sir ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , but she was her best friend and she had to trust her . Anna told her again : `` Pat do n't tell it to anyone please , especially to my brother everything will be ruin then '' . and Pat answered : `` Do n't wory I wo n't tell anyone '' .
I would like to travel in July because I have to go back to my country in Auguest . And I 'm sure about that the weather in July will be lovely !
I am writing to complain about the musical show which is called OVER THE RAINBOW . I saw the show on 17th of July .
For the date of the travel , I wonder if it would be possible in July because I 'm going to pass a very important exam at the end of June . Two weeks in the USA would be a great occasion for me to relax after that .
In there , students can have fun in the recreation areas , can watch a film and eat all kind of food and have shopping . We can have fun as well . And that 's why I recommend this place to you .
And computers , the most important product of technology . In the world , people spend the whole day by playing computers . Not only as a hobby . They use computers for their works . They connect with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers . Sometimes they do n't go to their offices . They write their secret notes into the computers . Computers hold them in their memory . But in the past people had to use lots of note books and they also had to find places to hide them .
Before using e-mail , I used to write letters and sometime telephon . However I 've found e-mail is better than them . Because as soon as I send my message , they can receive it . In the other word , I can also receive their reply soon . It 's really useful , when I need quick reply .
I also agree with you about the ticket 's prize . In fact , it was really a reasonably-priced ticket , excellent because you could go to all the events only with it . And that 's the reason because lots of people came .
In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort choosing things and making decissions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depends on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested to please .
I 'm writing to answer your question about rules in my life , at school and at home .
Howeve it was great job I have n't hade such experience . I could see a great number of pop stars in front of us . Can you believe that .
Shopping does not just effect us mentally , but also physically . It 's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping . Think of the awful crowds , the busy car parks , polluted air in the city centres and mile-long queues in front of the cash desks . I do n't think anyone would really like to face them . But once you get there , they 're just inevitable , are n't they ?
Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions .
Yours sincerely ,
b ) basketball and football games .
Thank you for your letter . I will try my best to answer the questions .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
I THINK THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS . MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECT ME IN SEVERAL WAYS , I MEAN THE MORE THE TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZES ; MORE CONFORTNESSCOMFORTABLE WE GET . NOW WITH MODERN MACHINES I CAN MAKE A BETTER USE OF MY TIME , IF I'AM LATE TO GO TO TRAINING AND I HAD N'T IT YET I JUST TAKE MY FOOD AND PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVEOVEN . ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE COMPUTERS , I THINK THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED MACHINE IN THE WORLD , YOU CAN LIVE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN A HOUSE WITHOUT GOING OUT , BY JUST USING THE INTERNET , IT HAS ALSO HELPED ME IN MY SCHOOL HOMEWORK , I MEAN IT 'S INCREDIBLE THE TIME YOU WAIST BY MAKING THING WITHOUT A COMPUTER . BUT I THINK ALSO THAT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE GET MORE COMFORTABLE SO THAT MAKES ME A PACIVE PERSON AND NOT SO ACTIVE , THIS CAN BE BAD TO BECAUSE IF I GET USED TO BE CONFORTABLE WHEN I NEED TO DO HARD WORKS I WO N'T BE ABLE TO DO THEM .
Tairs ran down my face as I admitted having stolen . I was suprised that my father did n't watch me but I soon understood that he was ignoring me .
You may be surprised to receive a letter from us . All the students are happy that we will have othe oppurtinatey , to visit London for three days . This trip would gives us the change to see London and to improve the english language . We all agree to the daily programme during the three days . In the morning , we will have the change , to see some of the sightseeings of London by bus , For example the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery .
Clothes is very interesting subjekt to study . If you travlling around you can see lot of different still from different culture .
Thank you for your letter which arrived me this morning .
This will be a tough challenge for this new century .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Today there are children that do n't know nothing about nature and its things .
Yours sincerely ,
You are the theatre 's manager so I suppose you are the right person to complain .
Yours sincerely ,
I arrived at the right time ( 19.30 ) that evening but the play , which was 'Over The Rainbow ' , started almost an hour later . And nobody told me why !
Recommendations ?
About the travel , I think it would be preferable to do it on July , which is a holiday periode and so I wo n't have any special obligations . While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent , so I can live closer to the nature . Anyway the accommodation is not a big problem for me , because I will be away most of the time . Stay a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worse thing to do , specialy during a trip ! Moreover would like if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball . Any little tournaments of this kind would be greateful .
We can watch this problem from two different points of view . From one side , this people chose to become public people . If we do n't want to be in the newspapers , we do n't do politics or movies ! But from the other , everybody has the right to have a secret garden , the right to be with his/her family without be disturbed by journalists and photographers . The case of the Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities .
In the letter you said that accommodation provided can be either tents or log cabins . I would prefer to stay in tents so that I will have the chance to be in contact with the nature as well as the scenery around .
I have just received your letter with congratulations and I am writing to you in order to provide you with information you need .
On the positive side , you and the group will be abe to learn more about Welsh art works which are presented on the wall , on the door and some furnitures . The building itself looks splendid and beautiful .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
Firstly , it is a good idea that the Festival is International . But in the advertisement it was written that the artists were from all the world and I saw only six nationalities .
Swimming is an activity I do since I was a boy , I still enjoy swimming especially when it 's in the sea , although I never took part in competition , that means I do swimming just for fun .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
As you can understand , it was a dreadful time and I went my money back as a solace for the dissapointment I had .
Finally I would like to practise basketball and swimming , because in my school I used to train those sports a lot . Even now in a sport center , but not much .
THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN BEING IS THE HISTORY OF THE CONQUER OF THE WORLD , THAT SAID , TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED CONTINOUSLY SINCE THE BEGGINING OF MAN 'S EVOLUTIVE PROCESS , FURTHERMORE , DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES , THERE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS TECHNOLOGICAL EXPLOSION , WHILE THE XIX CENTURY GAVE US THE STEAM MACHINE , THE FACTORIES AND THE ELECTRIC BULB , THIS CENTURY HAS GIVEN US THE NUCLEAR ENERGY ( AND SADLY THE ATOMIC WEAPONS ) , THE COMPUTER , INTERNET AND THE TELEVISION .
I WAIT YOUR ANSWER , AND OUR MONEY BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE .
About the programme , we suggest to see the show on the Tuesday morning and after to do shopping . As far as we are concerned we prefer seeing the Science Museum rather than the National Art Gallery . We also suggest to visit the Science Museum or Wednesday morning and the afternoon , if some one of us is intersted , we could see the National Art Gallery .
Some go just to kill the time others - to look at something new , I am in the third group - previously I think of what I will buy and go straight to the department I need .
Rie Tanizaki
As regards accommodation , I would like to stay in tents , because I used to going on holiday with my friends and staying in tents . It is just wonderful .
During the camp I would like to pratise my swimming ( I have attended swimming lessons for 3 years ) and also I would like to learn how to do some good photos . ( I have no experience ! )
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE NICE SURPRISE YOU 'VE BEEN GIVEN TO ME , I JUST CA N'T BELIEVE IT THAT I WON THE FIRST PRIZE . HERE IS THE INFORMATION YOU ASKED FOR :
At first , from your advert Danny Brook ( who is a very good singer I appreciate very much ) was not here . An unknown man was singing , not in tone - awful for my ears - ( poor Tina Truelove ! such a professional singer with a beginner ! )
- CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME HOW IS THE WEATHER THEN , SO I CAN TAKE THE PROPER CLOTHES ?
Brian learm what was happened and at first he was angry with Pat but then he thanked him . Jane and Brian were very happy .

Nowadays , technology is the most useful tool that human beings have . It affects everyone who live in this planet and every activity made in it .

My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about somethings that happened in the performance of the show Over the Rainbow , wich took place in your stablishment , The Circle Theater , that made me feel very upset .
Dear Helen Ryan :
The thing I realy liked , was helping the artists and talking to them . Oke , they screamed at me all the time because they were nervous and excited about their concert .
`` Yes , but our grandpa is dead , do n't you remember ? '' - I cried .
Dear Kim
I hope that I have covered all information you would need and look forward to seeing you .
Dear friend .
Recently , we have had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives . My life has also changed as a result of modern technology . Thanks to computers , phones , mobile phones , internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to do before . My father is a sailor and I meet him only four times a year . But thanks to mobile phone I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean . I also enjoy shopping through internet . This way I do n't have to do be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes . In the future I would love to be a doctor , especially a cardiologist . Nowadays , modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients .
The concert went terrific , too ! There must have been hundreds out there - dancing , laughing , shouting.. and I was having a time of my life ! I handed out refreshment to the pop group 's members during breaks - my friends were so jealous of me !
I was delighted to receive your letter and to know that a group of students from your college have decided to take a part in our international student conference .
Maby she did it to get friends . But in fact that day she had loosed my friendship .
THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA - Ernest Hemingway
There was an old married couple . They had no children . One day , the lady went to a river to wash clothes and the man went to a mountain to cut trees . In a bamboo forest , he found a shining bamboo . When he cut it , he found a beautiful baby girl in it . She was named bamboo princess .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Finally , I think that this evening was very far to be perfect , and I ask you for my money , I spent for this horrible evening in your theatre , back .
When I received my monthly pay , I rushed down to the shop and without thinking , bought that dress . I went back to where I was before - with no money ( and a black dress ) all over again .
Eternal crowds , high prices , long hours of choosing a suitable thing , that is what shopping means to me .
Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased to hear from you about my winning of the competition . I am writing to inform you my preferences and ask a few questions about the camping .
Dear Sirs ,
Sometimes , when you shopping on the street , you will see a lot of things that you like , and you ca n't buy it once , you will feel very sad maybe . And then , you may save money for the things you like , nothing to do , just for the poor things what you like so funny is n't it ?
However , there are a few moments in which you can not enjoy shopping . The first one is the Christmas period . Shops are incredibly crowded . You can not try on a dress and decide to buy it or not in peace , because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn . In many cases , you do not even find the things you want , because shops run out of products very quickly . Moreover , during this period , prices are usually much higher than in the other month 's .
Hello , how are you ? I 'm fine . Thank you for the letter . I got it today and could n't believe it ! As you asked me for some further information . I will write it down .
A little percentage , on the contrary , said it would be very useful to film the teacher when she is explaining us something important , to give the idea of the real life in our classroom . which is the most .
The boy had grown and had become very strong when he heard that there were lots of devils on Onigashima Island who robbed many people in Bizen of much money and many treasures . He made up his mind to defeat them , and asked his stepmother for some kibidango , one of traditional snacks in Japan . Having eaten the kibidango , he departed for Onigashima with three friends of him : a dog , a monkey and a bird .
Yours faithfully
Anyway . If you want to know about something of our country . I 'm glad to tell you more .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
And I choose phtograghy and tennis from the activities list . I am taking photograghy courses at univercity and I started tennis , when I was 10 so I am good at bouth of them .
In addition , I would rather sleep in a tent since I like being near nature and especially singing birds . Thus , I enjoy sports and I would like to practice swimming and climbing . I am not too bad at these sports .
G. Ramos
For the time that I will spend there I would like to chose more the two activities but I know is not possible so I chose swimming and singing . I usualy sing in my spare time and my friends love when I sing and about swimming I was champion last year in my city . So , I am quite good .
Yours faithfully :
Modern technology has got a big influence on our life . It is easier . We can communicate with people by using mobile phones or telephones which are the best things ever made . I use them very often in my daily life .
Secondly , the show has started with a delay of 45 minutes , and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed . Another problem was the starring male actor : the well known and talented actor , mentioned in the advertisement was replaced with another one , who was really very disappointing and after the performance , I visited the theater restaurant , which was said to be open and available for meals after the show ; but it was closed .
The real show on it owns is really very different to what are mentioned in the advertisement . I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back . Please would you also change the advertisement to the level of the actual facts .
It was great idea for doing something like that . There were jazz , rock and classical concerts , but some concerts hall were too small for all people , who took a part at that festival . There were also plays and films , dance shows , which I liked the most , art exhibitions and talks by writers , but it would be good to see more plays and films next year . Also a great idea was , that it was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events .
Secondly you asked me , when I have time for travel , so I can go only in July , because only in July I have holiday . And I would like to go in the first part of this month , socond part I spend with my familly .
If you really want to discover what greek history means , we strongly recommend you to visit the hystorical museum ! ! !

Pablo Fernandez
I look forward to receiving your next letter !
We want say thanks again for your help and you must be sure that your opinion it would be valuable to us .
On the other hand , there are few famous people desire to be watched by media . If media stopped focusing the people , they would think as if they are put in a bin like rubbish . Moreover , many people love to watch a gossip programme on TV or in a magazine . It is one of fun in our life .
Thank you very much for good programme ! We like it very much ! But we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show . It is on Tuesday . We think , that you also would like to go there , when you 'll know about it better . There will be showed the latest fashions . Also , we will see leisure and sports wear .
Thank you for your letter it was great to hear from you .
I liked that especially . I do n't like to tidy up , you know ! ! I like to face people whom even I do n't know . Foremost , after finishing my work , I could meet singers by chance ! !
I have already , saw others versions of this musical and Danny Brook is a bad actor , who ended with the musical .
Katerina .
During a week 's holiday I had in London , I went to see your last musical show called `` Over the rainbow '' at The Circle Theatre . I saw an advertising which seemed very atractive to me .
I have received your letter about the prize I have won in your competition . I would like to thank you and give some information you asked about me .
yours sincerely ,
During my holidays in London I went to see your musical show .
I am look forward to hearing from you

Mr. Robertson :
Apart from being in-fashion it is also a very helpful machine . Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car which would n't work ? What would you have done in that moment without a mobile phone ? You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you , amazing , is n't it ?
I am looking forward to hearing from you and I insist that you refund my lost money at once .
I would recommend the lessons and activities mentioned above in order to make the video in question .
Computers changed my life style , my opinion about the world . And they effect everyone 's life directly or indirectly .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
The concert was on a sunday and we had to work on the back of the stadge , doing all sorts of things like colecting rubish and helping other people that was working there . We was so close to him , I did n't have the chance to talk with him but I do n't mind , I will never forget that day . Since then , me and my sister talk about Luis Miguel every day .
I look forward to hearing from you in due course .
I was very please to receive your letter . It is my pleasure to help you organising the international student conference .
After reading the hole organized programme , we all agreed about the sightseeing by bus around London wich will give us the knowledge about this fantastic city we all want to meet since time ago .
Here is my article .
I really enjoyed to serve the drinks to the pop-stars . You could speak to them and you could see that a lot were very cool and the other ones were still in the sky . And you heard the concerts too .
Subject : a short video about daily life at school
( Rumgopol Rinsook ) .
Dear Monte ,
Yours sincerely ,
On the whole , people nowadays , do care more about their appearance and will be continuing to do .
Your sincerely
What is more , about the tickets , discounts were not available as it was not said so .
Thus , the musical show was n't as good as it should have been . I was very disappointed because D. Brook and T. Truelove are so great actors and I was very excited to see them .
For those students who are very interested in shopping , clothes shops , jewellery , stationary , book shops , fashion and beauty departments and many more are availiable . For those who want something more exciting and advanturous , you are recommanded to visit the Fun Fair and amusement on the top floor of the building . Other facilities such as cinemas , theatres , large department stores could also be found . There is a little souvenir shop for tourists and a special discount for tourists from aboard to enter the car park .
I thank you for your recent letter . First , I would like to congratulate on your new responsability , because of Mr Brown 's illness .
I 'm looking forward to hearing your answer .
Yours sincerely ,
On the other hand , I have to admit that technology makes things so easy that when I have to do them without it I find it very difficult . The best example is the homework I have to do for school , I ca n't manage to do it when I do n't have my computer to help . In addition to that , technology does n't sometimes let me develop my imagination and creative skills . My mother says that I 'm always playing with my computer or watching T.V . instead of reading or doing some more interesting activities .
Mark and his family decided to go for a walk in the Alps . So , her father prepared the car and her mother took some food for the journey .
I have safely received your letter bringing the good news . I wish that I could describe how ecstatic I felt when I found that I won the competition . Here I enclose some information which you requested in the letter I received .
I would also like to take tennis and painting activities while staying at the camp . I 've played tennis for eight years now and have competed in many matches . I take painting as my hobby as well , even though I have never took proper lessons .
When I think about it now , shopping is not always enjoyable .
Last week , I had visited your theatre and I was very disappointed because I did not have a perfect evening out like what advertisement said .
Dear Sir/Madam
I 'm looking forward do hearing from you ,
Dear Sir ,
Best wishes
17th June 2000
Hi Helen ,
Dear Manager ,
I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience .
Yours sincerely
Then , in the ticket says that the show started at 19.30 and , I do n't know why , it started at 20:15 , very unpolited of your side , and also , make me lose time .
I think it would be better for me to travel on July . I will started an Italian course in August , so it will be impossible for me to leave .
Also my kids have school holidays during this month therefore I hope to travel in mid of July .
Can you imagin you and your friends going picnic to the Moon with silvery skirt with Astronut boots with fire coming out at the bottom of your boots ? It could be more facinating .
We had a class discussion about shopping , for it I 'm writing to tell about my opinion .
I hope you will feel like me one day . I will write to you again soon and tell you how I getting on .
What can of clothes met it ?
I would like to travel in July because I have got summer holidays from July to August and I work as a bank clerk in August . I think a tent would suit my personal life-style better than a log cabin because I love the nature .
Your faithfull ,
My friend and I had just arrived at a small airport in the middle of the Californian desert . One man came out from a small building . It was our pilot . He introduced himself and we walked towards a small plane . The doors of the plane were so thin , that I thought I could torne them . We went inside and the plane took off . It was horrible . I could feel every movement which was caused by clowds or winds . I thought we would die .

I think it was definitely not a perfect evening as garenteed in your advertisement . I look forward to having a full refund in the very near future as I did not enjoy it at all .
In consequence of the reasons I have already explained , I would like to ask you if I can have my money back , but this is not the most important to me , because I want your theatre to change and become the best .
Yours faithfully
Yours sincerely ,
I believe the modern techonology can changed everyone especiale now with computer and all the athers machins . Personally modern technology change me a lot . First I can say about the combuter . Before I used same ather ways to take information or play or comunicate with people . Now all this I can do it from the computer . I can spend so many ours because day by day I discavered new things . Maby is not good because you do n't have the oportunite to meed people and talk face by face Exepted from computers we have telephone , T.V , gymnastick centers . All this are in my life .

Second , I 'd prefer have a log cabin where I could let some stuff .
Sometimes when we go shopping with someone who is not a good company , we usually do n't have a great time , or when we know what we want to buy , but when we get to the store they do n't have what we want , in that moment we neat to shop also when is an important day like Father 's day or christmas every where we want to go and buy something is very crowd so we ca n't find what we are looking for with calm because everybody is pushing you to the other place that you want to go
But when the show started , they said Danny was n't there because of his illness and I felt very upset and dismayed about it because the situation I had was unlike what the advertisement said . After the boring show finished , I was hungry and I decided to go to your theatre restaurant but the restaurant was closed after 19.00 . So what 's the point to say 'visit our restaurant after the show ' ?
Hi ! How are you doing ? I 'm fine . As you asked me about the concert , I 'll write about it today .
Dear Sir/Madam
On the advertisement it had been written that there would have been Danny Brook too . ( I like him very much and , truly , I came to the theatre just to see him )
To sum up , although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention any more , the fact that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not be changed .
For instances with the arrive of Internet , the new digital television or the researchers in the medecin ; we are discovering how we can change our lives only with press a botton , or look for something new with only think about it ... we realize that the new technology it have just begun , and lively in a few years we will be very avanced in this way .
Best Regards ,
Yours faithfully
If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends , of if something terriable has happened with me , I may not run somewhere to find a telephone box . I just use my mobile phone . Finally , I can say that modern technologies very help people at their works . With them people do their work more quikly and successfully .
Let me ask a question about clothes and money . What kind of clothes do I need and how much money do I have to take .
Last week I was shopping with my younger brother . Awful . He wanted everything what his eyes saw . All the stuff for children are in the same level as they have their eyes . Afterwards , I felt tired and unsatisfy the store .
Hereby I have to ask for money back or another discounts for me .
I am writing this letter because we saw your programme for our next trip to London and we would like to suggest you just one thing .
Yours Sincerely
I have recently recieved your letter that I have won the first prize in the competition . It was very fortuanate of me .
During my two week sat Camp California , I 'd like to practice climbing and surfing , whose basics I know perfectly well .
So I need now a `` perfect - money back - '' for replacement of your `` perfect evening out '' .
Yours sincerely ,
When , one day Pat came over to my house we started arguing about common things and in our fite suddenly came about the subject of my father and his problems . Pat started shouting and screaming , saying what was realy going on . My brother could n't stay away . He stand outside my door and heard every single word . When I realised it , it was too late . The secret was revilied . And now I try to help my brother beaus I 've been there , in his place , and I know how it feels .

Another thing that has changed my daily life is the mobil phone . As a matter of fact , if I am stuck in my car in the traffic , I can call my boyfriend to tell him that I would be late . Once , I saw an accident and I could call the police . Sometimes the ring is annoying but finally , the mobil phone is a great handy object .
I also would like to know if I have to take money and what kind of clothes are suitable for that location . Please reply soon .
I am writing to complain about the musical 'OVER THE RAINBOW ' . There were some unfortunate incidents .
I think we should book at the Palace Hotel . It is an outstanding building situated in the city centre .
I am sorry to make your inconveint . I hope it does n't make some trouble if you accept my suggestion .
In conclusion , I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidently meet a bad situation or you can not control your expenditure carefully .
Dear George ,
Yours Sincerely ,
The hotel is ten minutes far from the conference and there will be a bus available to go directly over there .
It is rare the schools that do n't have a multimedia centre with many computers to the students use . But it is good and bad in the same time . Good because you can have acess to a lot of informations , and it is bad because the computers are getting the people 's work . Nowadays we have teachers , and tomorrow ? Who have the certain that the computers will not get the place of the teachers ? It is interesting to starts to think about this point .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
Then , I did not get a discount and I had to buy a full-price ticket , although I am not adult yet .
An argument in favour of this statement is that shopping is very tiring . You can be walking for hours and finally you ca n't find anything that you like .
Dear Kim !
I received your letter last week and was surprised to see that I won a competition . It is the first time it happens to me .
However , there are a lot of negative aspects in the way that technology affects my life . As technology develops so fast , there are always new things to buy , and it also reduces the amount of jobs available , so it is getting hard to find a job .
Competition Organiser
Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression . You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have , buying clothes , jewells , furnitures , etc . and you could have a real great time .
I am writing to reply your letter you wrote me on 10 June .
yours faithfully ,
In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisment and I would be gratefull if you could give me back a part of my money .
Yours sincerely
I am writing to complain about your music show entitled `` Over the Rainbow '' Which I saw during my holiday in London .
As a conclusion I would like to ask you about the money and the cloths I must take with . Please drop me a line
To : Mrs. Sexington
Yours sincerely ,
Yours sincirely :
Thank you very much for your letter . I was very glad to hear that I had won first prize in the competition .
Thanks very much for your last letter . Because I could see how anxious you are to know about my experience at the Radiohead concert last month , I 'll tell you something : it was fantastic .
The secret
I am sure you can understand my disappointment . I must insist that you refund the cost of the show . Unless I hear from you within ten days , I shall have to take legal advice on the matter .
SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE .
Dear Sir , or Madam ,
I want to do this two activities while I am at the camp : Sailing and photography . I have great experience for sailing . I used to work for a sailing company in Turkey . And I have done certificate for using radio ( VHF ) . I have knowladge about navigation , engine , ropes and knots and sails as well .
Dear Kim ,
And I would like to have a chance about painting and photography . I am not so fit and well condition , so I do n't like to do activitily . However , to draw some beautiful sceanary and to take some picture are very good experience for me . I hope so much .
To begin with , it was not Danny Book who acting in the show , as you wrotte .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction about the musical show I had seen yesterday , called 'Over The Rainbow ' .
With love
A few years ago , I did not know what Internet was , how to use it and so on . But , while those have been spread all over the world , I and all the other people who I have known became to use them .
Another disappointing thing I found was that the restaurant was closed because the cooker has had an accident with hot water when he was boiling some vegetables .
Moreover it was written that the musical was between 14:30-19:30 . Suprisingly the show started at 20:15 . That destroyed all my plans . Then I decided to have a dinner at your Theatre Restaurant after the show , but unfortunately it was closed .
Conclution
I thin it 's a wonderful idea and my advice is to take it if you have an offer ! I had so much fun helping my friends ' band having their concert .
Egyptians , Mayas , Incas , etc . were civilisations with great knowledge because they were mastering most of the science fields we deal with today .
Shopping sounds very enjobleable and fantastic for women . You can find a lot of interesting things which you unexpected . Some people enjoy window shopping , but some people enjoy spending their money on their clothes or shoes . Nowadays in a family shopping is n't women 's job .
I would be really greateful if you could send me some information or any relevant brochure .
AFTER THE SHOW I GOT OUT THE SHOW ROOM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED AND WENT TO THE RESTAURANT TO DRINK SOMETHING TO RELAX , AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ? .. IT WAS CLOSED ! I COULD N'T BELIVE IT HOW THIS CLASS OF THEATRE CAN BE SO .. OH I 'M GETING MAD AGAIN SO I'AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE LAST THING , IT WAS THE HORRIBLE NIGHT I HAD EVER GOT SO I DEMEND FOR MY MONEY BACK !
We will have a great party at the end of the conference . The party will be formal , therefore you have to wear formal clothes like a suit or a dress . As you know , it is not suitable to wear a jean or something .
Due to my business , I am very busy and that it is the best moment for my business so , I ca n't manage my time to go on holiday but I 'd be able to travel at anytime in July . I would prefer to stay in a tent as I feel that it would be more exciting than staying in a log cabin . As you offered me two activities , I would like to go on swimming . I am not a good swimmer yet but soon I will be . I have been learning swimming for the last eight months and I really enjoyed it . Another sport I experience is Basketball which I used to play for a school 's team when I studied at secondary school . I have not been practising it at all recently but only wish I had . This trip will certainly be a good opportunity for me to start playing it again .
I would like to change the rule not to speak in Spanish at school because most of us feel more comfortable speaking in Spanish but I guess to learn . we should speak English all the time .
First of all I would like to apreciate for your generous award . I was dreaming of a holiday for such a long time . Now I have the opurtuanity so I shall inform you fully .
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like very much the nature and camping , so I think that I will be better in a tent than in a log cabin .
Any way , it was a great experience and I enjoy it very much . The part I enjoyed most was the one when they paid me . It was n't much but that means nothing when you have the chance to take part in an event like that . They also gave me a ticket to wotch the concert live . Great show .
Next day , I decided that I do n't want to go to school any more . I was afraid that everybody would comment my first lesson . I wish I had n't told Pat about my plans . Eventually the things were n't so bad . I went to school and everyone was very friendly . Pat appologized me for not keeping the secrets . At the begining I was very angry but in the end I said that everything is O.K .
The princess grew up beautifully . Some princes proposed her . But she said to them , `` if you want me , you have to do this . '' and asked them to do impossible things because she did n't want to get married . One day , the old couple saw the princess crying . When they asked her , she said `` I am from the moon and I will have to go back soon '' . They really loved her and they asked a prince who loved the princess to protect her . But , one the day , the princess went back to the moon with guards from the moon although the prince and his army tried hard to protect her .
I 'm so happy that I 've won 2 weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. At first I could n't belive that I was a winer
16.12.00
Anyway , there are some questions I 'd like to ask you : What kind of clothes would be the most suitable for California weather in summer , and how much money do you think I 'll need ?
I will be pleased to swim and paint when I am at the camp . I selected swimming because it is a cure against my backace and I have not practiced since I started my new job five years ago . I also choosed painting because I have never done before , I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a calm activity .
Yours faithfully ,
With reference to the letter from you . I would like to inform some further information as follow .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Secondly , the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 mentioned on the advertisement .
Due to my huge dissatisfaction , I would like my money back , as you do not make what was advertised .
Yours sincerely ,
In your letter you are asking me to chose which accomodation I prefer . I would like very much to stay in tents . Last year I stay in tents with some friends in England and I really enjoyed it . Summer time the weather is good and I do n't see any problem anywhere I will stay .
Yours sincerely
Moreover , as your advertisement , we would get discount price for the ticket , but it was not available .
yours faithfully
Yu Phu Tung .
The conference will take one hour , and , at 8 o'clock the party will start , it is a formal party and you should wear formal stuff . The dress code is : no jeans . We will prove you with food and drinks .
I am writing to complain about the musical show , OVER THE RAINBOW , and also about the servic .
I am writing to complain about your musical show `` Over the Rainbow '' . Last week I was on holiday at London and I was very dissappointed when I visited your theatre .
Imagine your life without a telephone . Yes , I know , it is just hard to imagine our lives without this invention .
Or do they want to be persecuted buy the media ?
First of all , the reason why I bought the ticket was Danny Brook , who is my favorite star , and was going to play for the show . However , there was a different actor instead of him , and this was most my disappointment .
Yours faithfully ,
Moreover , when I went to buy the tickets no discounts were avaliable .
You 'd like to know how was the Top-Pop Concert , which I helped to organise last month . It was absolutlly great ! I was responsible about a security of one of the sectors . I gave information about correct ways to another places like tooletes and medical points . I was also asked about a timetable of the concert and I looked for drugs , knifes and so on in bags . Although I worked I watched the concert . I was big fun ! People danced , screamed and sung with a singer . I looked very carefully at organisation of the event , you know I 'm interestsing in it .
I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans . Syntethic materials have grown up and become very popular so it would keep going on . But maybe the shape of the clothes will changed : large pants as `` baggy '' , or trousers with many pockets as we see today . For women , clothes change more than for men 's . It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothes . I guess they will wear a sort of tunique upon a shirt and a skirt , or more male clothes because they want to change . Finally it 's very difficult to say that .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I would prefer to be accomodated in tents because I love camping but I do n't mind also the second possibility .
About a millenium ago every thing was different the people did n't have electricity , they did their food on the fire and they did n't have pens .
Yours sincerely
Finally , I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably-priced ticket for the weekend is excellent , we can go where we want to , see what we feel like to . However , I think a weekend is really too short . May I suggest you to think about doing the festival over one week .
Yours sincerely ,
I really enjoy swimming and playing tennis . Unfortunetley I am not good at both of them . Maybe I will have time to do enough practise as much as I always wanted to do .
Another disadvatage of the festival 's programme was lack of plays and films which are the best to display the modern county 's culture . I suppose . I hope there will be more of them next year .
Sometimes it is n't so easy to find what you need . For example : you have in your memory a great pair of shoes that you have seen last week in a shop . Now you will by it but it 's nowhere to find ! That 's a pity !
On the other hand , life will be boring , a large amount of workers will be have redundant and housewives will not have anything to do which will be extremely boring and tedious .
Dear Kim ,
And now about my home .
As I was spending a week-end in London I took a chance too see the performance of one of my favourite actors , Danny Brook . Unfortunately as soon as I came to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore . Besides , since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we had n't had any dinner , as we had been thinking to have it at your restaurant . You can not imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been posticipated at 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of restructuring ; as a matter of fact , after the show we only ate an hamburger in a fast-food .
In the opposite , shopping can be disenjoyable .
I was very disappointed of my supposed `` perfect evening out '' to your theatre and due to all the above-mentioned reasons I am asking for a complete refund on the two attached tickets .
Nevertheless , the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage , which is terribly crowded . You can not make a step without `` touching '' the others . It gets enormously unbearable in hot summer days , when the temperature increases . In such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring . But the worst moment comes , if you can not find the thing you were looking for , because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out .
Well , I hope you wo n't be as lazy as me and you 'll write soon .
There are many different people 's inventions around us . We are so used to them , that sometimes think they existed always . Some of them are very practical , other are rather strange .

The plays and the films were really great . I enjoyed all of them . I hope to see much more films next year .
Dear Jane Clark ,
One day as I was talking with my teacher about the project I saw what it could be the final answer sheet exam on the top of his desk . Suddenly , when the teacher went out of his office , I quickly copied the answers on my notebook , I could n't believe it , that would be the easiest exam I would had ever done . As I went out of the office I found walking down the corridor Pat , my best friend . As she was also making the project I decided to let her copy the answers . I told her she had n't to talk about that to anybody . She agreed and went home very happy . When night came I could n't believe what was happening . Almost all my class mates were in the front door of my house asking me if I had the solutions of the exam . I could n't believe that my best friend had told everybody about my secret .
You want to know some further information from me . About the date , when I want to travel can I say that it is only possible for me on July because I have to do some exams at the school . I would prefer to the accommodation at the camp a tent , the reason is that I like to live realy natural and it is more enjoyable to live in a tent then in cabins .
Your sincerely ,
I was exhausted when the concert finished , anyway it has been one of my best experience and I 'll remember for life .
I had to search in the internet pictures that could be used for the flier . We booked the accommodation for the group . I was responsible for checking the light and sound . In addition I checked the e-mail dialy and answered the phone . As you know I sold tickets in some schools and pubs , too .
We would like to ask you whether we can change some programme . Our suggestion is that we can go shopping on Wednesday 15 March so on Tuesday afternoon we can go to The London Fashion and Leisure Show . We wo n't miss any programme that you have planned and we could also have great opportunity to see the show .
Why do n't you buy the green one ? Oh , no ! That 's horrible , mum ! This is one of a normal scene when a mother and her daughter are buying and getting clothes from the shelves . That is what most of the women love . They love going to a shopping centre and put lots of clothes on . That 's so good when you have money for joy it but , appart from that , there are many problems .
Yours sincerely
I am also pleased to have the chance to do some activities and I would like to choose something I am not able to do so . So , I have decided to chose photography and surfing because I am an absolute beginner at both of them .
I am looking forward to hearing you .
Yours sincerely ,

I write this letter to you for explain my very bad evening I have passed in theatre . On the paper it was writting the principal actor is `` Danny Brook '' but it was n't him , it was a different actor that we have never seen , and heard . I think it 's really not correct .
Thank you in advanced for your comprehention and we look forward to hearing for you .

Shopping is not always enjoyable
16 , Dec. 2000
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT ... BECAUSE
I think modern techonology has changed my daily life a lot and I hope it will develop even more to change my life even more .
In our opinion , we should go to the show . Firstly , because we are keen on fashion . Secondaly , because we do not have to pay for the tickets .
Dear Andy :
In short , the Amusement Centre is fascinating place and it deserves a visit . I would highly recommend this building , because not only you can enjoy yourself but also experience Korean culture which might be exotic to foreign visitors .
When I started work , I wrote everything I made on sheets and if sometimes I made mistakes , I had to cross out and it was n't very well-made . I had to work out all my figures two times to make sure that my accounts were accurate .
All of her funs were stooud up the whole concert and dancing . I was so exciting night .
Thank you for your letter it was so nice to hear from you gain and I am glad you have meant this subject .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I would like to do Tennis and Photography . I am in the team for tennis at school and I have played against different other schools before . I also enjoy photography . I am doing this subject for my G.C.S.E . so it would be very helpful for me to practise .
Finally , I have two questions more : I wonder if I can change my french money in the Camp and what kind of clothes I have to buy before coming ?
Thank you very much for your programme but we have another plan to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show which unluckily on the same day as the day we would visit the Science Museum so we would like you to change the plan a little . Your programme is very good , especially that we can go to visit the Science Museum which I heard is very good but a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a good opportunity for us to see the lastest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hair styles and it is free for students too . So we think we should change your programme by going to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon and to do the shopping after the show .
Yours sincerely
Your Sincerely
I would be grateful if you would give me more information .
Technology is the thing that makes our life easy . Technology is in every part of our life .
First of all you said that the starring would be Danny Brook but there was not . Another actor took his place .
16.12.00
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students , I strongly reccomend it for their excursion and their interests .
Secondly I think we have more mixing clothes from all over the world , because we are traveling more and more around . And that is nice if you can pick up the best thing from all over the world , but on the other hand it is not so nice if every country wear some type of clothes .
In addition , it was a nine days hard work to mount all the different spot and houndreds of Coblights on the right place .
Sara was a very good puple . She did n't learn a lot but she knew all important things . She was a very nice person and she helped always if somebody need her help .

I am very happy to hear that I 've won first prize in your competition . Below I provide you with the information that you asked me for . I would like to travel in July . I already have plans for my holiday and July suits me the best . As for accomodation I would prefer log cabins , because I belive they are more comfortable then tents .
The event is a great opportunity because it is on the 14th of March and it is free for students . For pratical informations , this show start at 10.00 and close at 19.00 . It will stay in the Central Exhibition Hall in London . It is not too far and the openning hours fit us .
I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely dissapointed about the show . I got to the theatre at 18:30 because I wanted to drink before I get to the hall so I got there earlier . The show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 . It was about fourty five minutes later than original starting time . I was just a bit upset but I was n't that upset much at that time . The thing which made me really upset was the actor . The actor should be Danny Brook but it was another man who I have n't seen before . I liked Danny Brook so much and I was expecting to see him but you did n't even mention about that actor was going to change to another guy . This thing should n't be happened .
Love ,
Thuesday 13th June 2000
Due to all this troubel I think we should have our money back . We both have £15 tickets . And to an other time , make soure that your advertisment is correkt !
I received your letter . I do not want to keep you curious any longer . The oppurnity of being able to help in the concert knocked on my door by chance . I heard they were looking for volunteers to help at the pop concert . I , ofcourse jumped into it . The idea of meeting a worldwide known pop singer ; just made my heart punch my ribcage . The concert was all ready filled up with thousands , although it was really early . We , the volunteers first unravelled the cables , set the microphones and some instruments . Then we , were told go to the back stage and make sure everything was perfect . After a fantastic concert I actually had the chance to meet Britney Spears . She is a very nice person I managed to scavange an authograph for you as well I will put it in the envelope .
Finally , may I ask some more informations . What kinds of clothes shall I take ? how about the weather there ? Would you give me some pocket-money during the trip . Also , may I take a friend with me , how much will she pay ?
A wonderful example for modern technology : Computer ! It is not a living thing but it has a brain . It knows more than most of the people .
I would like to know if I need special clothes , extra money or any other things . Could you please send me more details about that ...
Anyway , by the time we finished everything , thusands of funs came in this concert hall . Everybody looked very excited about the concert .
I am especially glad about the activities offers , in particular the sports facilities because I was spezialised in sport for my A-levels and intend to become a sport teacher .
I had never wanted to be a hero
I started to have a lot of new friends , they all wanted to be my best friend .

Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend , that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on , you have to bear with the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien into their territory .
I hope you will find all the details , which you would like to have in the letter . If you need any information , please let me know .
Every woman in the world likes the word shopping . It is like if they lose their concience while they are shopping .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I should n't have told her that my dad had physcological problems . I knew that she was going to spread it around and tell it to my brother .
'Shopping ' stands for buying goods for your daily requirements , e.g . food , clothes . We do not speak here about luxuary goods .
To be honest , next great invention of people , computer , ca n't work , if you have n't got the phone . So I am very grateful to man , who invented it , unfornutely , I have forgotten his name . It always happens with people , does n't ? Try to ask who invented the will or the book .
At last I was waiting to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because a machine was broken . This was very disappointing .
Shopping is Not Enjoy Anymore
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
in the future it could be that you do n't have to prepare your breakfast by your own , perhaps you just have to press a button when your alarm clock has gone . In addition to this you may have some roboters bringing the newspaper at the table , tidying up the house , doing the shopping and maybe they are also your living patners .
Yours faithfully
I am Margherita X from the class 3C , which is going to spend three days in London . We had the opportunity to read your programme and we are happy because it is very good organized . We especially like the National Art gallery . Thank you .
Maybe , I could be a good way to get spectators but I 'm going to comunicate that to my travel office .
Well I have to go now . Hope to hear from you later on .
Dear Mrs Ryan
It was a great idea to organize such festival . I am a teacher and I love music . Most of the events which I had seen were good . I enjoyed dance shows , jazz and rock concerts . I visited art exhibitions . There were a lot of nice pictures , sculptures and other creative works . I was impressed by them . At festival I could talk with writers . It was an excellent idea to make one reasonaly-priced weekend ticket for all events . A lot of people could visit as many events as the they could .
But the discovery that I 'm most thankful to is the computor and the Internet ! Thanks to it , I can easy communicate with my family and friends at home when I 'm here in England . It 's so quick and not too expensive either . To use the mobile phone by the way , is very expensive . I usually use it for sending SMS Messages to my friends .
Dear Kim ,
I am very dissapointed with this evening and with the desorganized way of deal with problems so I am asking my money back .
To conclude , I was very happy to have a ticket for all events at one reasonally price , because for someone who do not like especially art , it was very attractive .
Yours faithfully ,
From : Meng
I know you will understand my frustration and that 's why I would like a total refund of my money or at least another ticket that goes with my wishes .
Give my best wishes to your family
King Regards
Thirdly , the only one restaurant in your theatre was closed because of renovating it .
The student
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
First of all the show was supposed to start at 19.30 , but it was delayed untill 20.15 , and when the show finally began we were supriced to see that Danny Brook who was the star of the show , was not playing and someone else had replace him and he was really disappointing .
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED , BECAUSE THAT EVENING OUT WAS NOT PERFECT AS I HAD PLANNED .
Once again , thanks .
Best wishes ,
I am writing to you to complain about the unexpected evening I had when I went to see the musical show `` Over the rainbow '' in your theatre .
Yours sincerely
About the end-of-conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night , and a special guest I still do n't know will be expected . I suggest to wear casual clothes , I think there 's no need of school uniforms .
Last weekend , I have been in London with my friend and I saw your musical show `` over the Rainbow '' .
Though Internet has a lot of positive aspects I think you should be careful with it and not to be depended on it .
Bye for now
I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund . I expect to receive a cheque for £20 . look forward to hearing soon .
Thanking you in anticipation for your help , I look forward to hearin from you .
Thank you for making a great festival which made all the art activities come together .
I am very disappointed , and if it is possible , I want you to return my money back .
Yours faithfully ,
13 . June . 00
Your sincerely
If you have any further questions , just let me know
That was a charity concert to save money to poor people of AFRICA .
Especially , I ca n't support to do shopping with my mother : it takes so much time that later I regret of agreeing to go with .
Dear Sir ,
CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP , PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO THE ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED . I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE AT ALL . REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY . I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS . PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY .
The life style has change already from past . Shopping is common activity in their life . We must focus on the specific life style , which will make us enjoyable .
We think that it will be a great opportunity for us to see this show because we are all interested in fashion .
Thank you very much for your attencion on my regard
. I prefer to stay in log cabins than in tentes , because log cabins has much esctructure , that I need to stay for a few days .
I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some doubts , please do not hestitate to contact us .
As I 'm a student , I usually get discounts on different things , so I was so disappointed when I could n't get it here !
Our English class has an additional wish concerning the programme of our trip . We have seen an advertisement for the `` London Fashion and Leisure Show '' and we would all like to go to the show . We think it is a great opportunity because it only takes place once a year and it is free for students . We would suggest to replace the shopping part on Tuesday afternoon by the visit of the show . We think we would all have another chance for shopping in London sometimes later .
Dear John ,
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
Karol Johannes
At the end I would like to say that my evening out two days before was not perfect and I wold be glad if you could pay my some money back .
My name is Alida Fanetti , and I 'm writing you about the musical show which I saw during my stay in London recently .
I hope you 'll enjoy visiting there .
You will ask me why , the reason is the above ... '' unify '' . In addition `` the students must not use any commercial paper bags ( received at department store etc ) '' . Now you know the reason !
Last month , I helped at a pop concert by chance . I have just as a normal worker but I have met so many famous singers who I ever seen on TV . Of course , I could listen to all their music which were so cool . After the concert I had got an opportunity to join them to the party . The best thing was that I have learned how to control their expensive instruments and I have sung my favorite songs with them .
I started my plan . I went to Pat 's house but her brother told me that she was n't there . I offered to wait ... Her brother and I began to talk ... He 's such a nice boy . I liked him very much and I guessed he liked me too ...
Secondly , I will give you with pleasure some information about myself you need to have .
In Conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy . Otherwise If you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood . You should avoid the peak times .
I think women , in general , are very impulsive purchasing things . Many times we buy things that in fact , we do n't need and , sometimes you surprise when you check the balance of your bank account and then you need to cut down your expenses for 2 months .
I must say though , I would have to travel on July because it 's the summer holydays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friend if it is possible .

Dear Jane ,
Your faithfully ,
Subject : which lessons and other activities should be filmed
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU . I SEND YOU SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF ME WITH THE BAND .
I received your letter this morning and I would like to thank you for your interest in the Conference . I hope I can answer your questions .
I expect that much more various kinds of plays and films will be on next year .
At the beginning of the last Century only a few very rich people could afford a car ; it was kind of leisure or sport to drive one . Today almost everyone owns a car and needs it for daily activities . The transport network has changed according to this social evolution .
Report about which lessons and activities we should film .
Anyway , I 've enjoyed it very much ! It was the best experience I 've ever had in my whole life . I was trying to be with the singers all the time . It was fantastic . I wanted to touch them , as the only way to convince myself that I was with them .
13th July 2000
Yours sincerely ,
I 'll be taking an English Examination at the end of June and I think it would be a good idea if I can travel in July because it 's the only month I can spend abroad this year .
From this moment , I knew without the shadow of a doubt that my mother would know it sooner or later . It was only a question of hours before my life would collapse . I tried to take it on my stride but I could n't . I was terrified .
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen , probably by a gypsie . I was so annoyed ! I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny ! My friends lent me some money , but it was n't more than 120 pounds . I had to buy my dress , it 's accesories and besides clothes and souvenirs ! I could n't really do much , so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs . I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop .
Thesedays we are living on a high-technology world . Modern technology has been growing rapidly and it has effected me a lot . Indeed , I have to save more money for upgrading my personal computer . Computer technology keeps improving all the time and consumes like me and you definitely have to pay our money to keep our personal computer up to date and able to work with new computer softwares that require more and more performance of computer hardware .
Yours faithfully ,
Please , when you recive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything .
Secondly I also would like to say that the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it did not start until 20.15 . Finally when it started we noticed to our suprisement that it was not the right actor . Very disappointing as Danny Brook is my favourite actor . We saw the musical in sadness .
About the accomodation , I would prefer tents because I enjoy the contact with nature as well as camping activities .
Another option is to wash your neighbour 's car . In this case you need to buy the materials you will work with , but do n't worry , soap is not very expensive .
Dear Kim ,
In summarizing shopping can be enjoyable or not depending of our healthy state . Giving examples : we are healthy we buy clothes and Records , we enjoy ourselves ; we are sick , or our relatives , we buy medicines we not enjoy ourselves because it is an obligation .
sorry , I 'm late I know , but now I will tell you something about my experience last month .
To sum up , modern technology is changing my work , my life , and my friends .
I would like travel July because I will have holidays in this mounth .
This are too many negatives points for one evening . I am afraid , but I want my money back . I hope you do not disappoint my in this point .
All over , the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone .
Firstly , according to your advertisement , the 'Stars and artists from around the world ' came from only six countries . I felt quite disappointed as everybody knows that `` our '' world is full of different cultures . Maybe not enough were represented .
Competition Organiser
After the concert I only help with tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean . Later the band was talking to me , I could get their new album free , and some other souvenirs from the band .
In order to live happily the sciencetist can easily perdict the changes on earth , so than we can have time to perpare or defence our self from the Natural diseasters .
I prefer to stay in log cabin rather than in tent because I am not used to with narrow space and feel more comfortable with a place like bedroom .
Since I am a student and not as rich as Bill gates , I was short of money and I was very pleased to hear that there were discounts available for the tickets ; but I had to give the exact price of the ticket , which I consider as a fault of your theatre .
DENIS JIMENEZ
Looking forward to hearing from you soon .
I am writing to make a complaint about the Circle Theatre . I recently went there to see the musical show `` Over the Rainbow '' . I was very disapointed to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true .
Dear Sir ,
THE BIG FAULT
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Moreover , shopping is just a part of life style . It 's necessary to buy something to alive . We have to buy for some thing . For example , for our jobs supecial ceremonys and so on . Even when the risk comes up with shopping .
Dear sir ,
Another period when I do n't like doing shopping is when there is a huge sale ! I always go absolutely crazy when I have to do shopping then ! You can not breath , you can not see anything apart from a bulk of shouting women and men who want to get something cheaper !
I have a suggestion on how the programme could be changed . The shopping time could be after the show and the free time exchanged for the science museum . If we go to the show , we can do without the free time .
As requested , it has collected some information about the school . Below is a summary of the most important relevent points with some recommendations .
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I am looking forward to your answer .
The most interesting lessons for pupils are lessons in which we can do something real , concrete . for example , the lessons of mechanics or physics are very interesting . And especially the practical work . It would be great if we show it in our film , it might be also very interesting to watch it .
4 I have also thought in the show there was no different actor .
However , the students in my class , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show which will be on 14th March between 10.00 to 19.00 at the Central Exhibition Hall , London . The show has many interesting parts such as latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and Hairstyles and we are all agreed that it 's a great opportunity for us because most of us are going to study Fashion and Design course in next term and the other students are also interesting in new fashion . So we think that it will be useful for all of us .
I am sorry to say that I do not enjoy the evening at your theatre at all . I hope you can pay me the money back as compensation . I am waiting for your reply .
Dear Sir ,
I went to see Over the rainbow Show , Friday evening the 16/6 . The musical had been advertised to be London 's newest and best musical , but all to my disappointment .
In my opinion modern technology changed our daily life tremendously .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
As far as accommodation is concerned , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , because tents are too hot for me .
To make matters worse , despite the fact that the second show of the day was scheduled to start from 7:30 p.m , it started from 8:15 p.m. What 's more , the theatre restaurant was closed , because the chef suddenly took a day off . On top of everything , although your advertisement told me that I would receive some discounts , there were no discounts available .
Dear Kim ,
Could you please include in your next letter some information about the amount of money and clothes we have to carry ?
If we do n't use them we suffer from them . In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car . I really need it to escape from the pollution , mainly caused by cars and any other four-wheel motored vehicle . Is n't that contradictorious ? To go to the countryside and being able to breath fresh , non-polluted air , I use my car , which , as far as I am concerned does not help to maintain a clean air at all .
At the camp I will like to choose two activities , Painting and Singing , I love painting , in the university I studied art for two years , but now I do n't have much time to paint couse I work in a bank and I have a baby . So I will be very happy to improve my art in the camp . The reason of my option for singing is couse I feel embarrest about my voice , so maybe I could get it better .
Ring T Lun
Shooping is not always enjoyable .
In my opinion people need a telephone . For example a telephone is very important in job-life . Nowadays there are no companies which do not have a telephone . Also it is god for people 's safety . You can call the police if you are in danger or the ambulance if you are injured .
17th JUNE 2000 .
Dear Kim ,
If weather is hot then we do n't have to wear under wear because very thin and light clothes will support our bodies . There will be two functions for summer clothes that we do n't need to wear clothes like layer and layer . For example , T-shirts for women are included bra : easy to take it out when you wash it , is very simple and comfortable . What about short pants ? You do n't have to wear knickers . We can just put some thin pads in there . We ca n't feel it and easy to remove and just can wash it . Simplest is the best in summer !
The advertisement say 'your perfect evening out ' , however it was the worst evening I have had in London . I would like you give me my money back .
The aim of this report is giving some suggestions to a group of American students who has just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit .
Yours sincerely
I look forward to hear from you .
And if this were not enough , I had no discount in the ticket as was written . Beside this , we where invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show , but it was closed because it was being redecorated . So why you make this invitation ?
Yours sincerely ,
The show should start at 19.30 , but it did n't start until 20.15 ! So , because of that , I missed my last bus home !
I have visited your theater and I was very dissapointed because of the number of reasons .
Firstly , I 'd like to travel in July because I 've already resistered another summer course which starts in the end of July . Sorry about that but I can make that travel only in July .
First , I 'd like to travel on July because my friend , who is French , is coming to Toronto on August . Therefore , I 'd like to show her around and spend time with her as much as possible .
I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disapointed experience I have ever passed . So because of this horrible evening I want to ask for my money back .
It was really a reasonably-priced weekend for me , but you should also recognise new activities like competitions on singing songs , drawing a portrate next year . Then it would be excellent .
Yours faithfully
On the other hand , the theatre restaurant was closed because unknown reasons .
Austria , 13th June 200
BRASILIA ( DF ) , JUNE 17th 2000
When I arrived there , the staff were already busy . At first I just helped setting up the stage ; setting microphones , and tuning guiters . When I was doing it , one of the staff called me and brought me to a room . He explained me that it was to controll the light . It was fun practicing how to move the lights and change the lights . However , when it came to the real concert , it was very hard .
16.12.00
I think more and more people will have at least one flat , does n't matter if you are rich or not . The rooms will be designed in a future fashion like less furniture and everything is compact , even TV-set will be on the ciling . The rooms will be much bigger and wider than now , and you can have up to twenty rooms in your own flat , and even swiching on the light by saying only ; `` light '' .
At first , which kind of clothes I need take with me , because I do n't know anything about the weather in California , and at tend how much money I will need .
Luna Juarez .
If you are interested by more moderns buildings I can suggest you to visit `` Caldea '' which is a very modern bath centre with a beautiful architecture .
On the one hand , I think that some famous people are looking for the media attention . Indeed , it can be useful for their career . The more they are in the media , the more they will be famous . According to me , some of them need to be appreciated by fans , they need to be loved and see themselves on television . However , some others only use the media to come back , because they can not find a job anymore . They need to be famous again . Besides , I consider that some stars sometimes call journalist to tell them where they will be , in order to have free advertisement . Moreover , according to me , it is also a good way for them to earn money . Famous people are so often asked to give interview that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it , either in the newspapers or on television .
Lots of love ,
You have also written in your advertisement that it would started at half past seven but it started at 20:15 ! So we had to wait more than a half hour . It would n't be mind if the restaurant had pressed in order to eat or drink something , but it was closed , and it had n't also opened after the show , because the waitress had to clean up the theatre room .
I still often forget my birthday , but I will never forget that special one I had two years ago .
Next , I would like to find out some details about the camp . I need to know if my travel will take place in August . If I had known that I won , I would not have arranged my english course in Britain . Before . The next point is the accommodation . You mentioned that it will be in tents or log cabins . I would prefer staying in tents . I am very close to the nature , so it will be a pleasure for me .
Looking forward to seeing you ,
After the show , which was n't really the best I have ever seen , my family and I wanted to get some snacks in the theatre restaurant . When we arrived at the restaurant we had to realize that it was closed because the cook was ill. After this last point of troubles we went home with only bad remembers of this evening .
I think technology has changed my life and the way of living of almost all people around the world .
Yours faithfully
Faithfully yours ,
I find shopping is the most time consuming . If I want to buy a nice pair of shoe , I 'll have to go into a city centre and browse around from shops to shops until I find the shoes I like . If I 'm not lucky enough to find one , then I 'll have to take a train trip to a larger shopping places such as London .
Marlene Berg
On the other hand , we should be interested in the other activities such as sports wich could appeal more students in our school . For example , our basketball team has won a local championship .
I would appreciate if you send me a reply for my Questions as soon as possible
But I think there will not be many changes concerning the furnishing of the future homes . All the big and small things which are defining people 's personal environment will be left nearly unchanged - the furniture , the pictures on the wall ... .
Dear Sandro ,
Dear Helen Ryan
I am not satisfied with this musical show at all .
received letter from you , because I know , that you are busy , but please look at my suggestion for next year 's festival .
I will contact you , if I will have more questions .
Pat and Jim 's wife lived with the guilty all their long lives . How could they forget it ?
Now in the age of seventeen I made the huge mistake to say , this problem to my `` friend '' Pat . I knew that she is close to my brother and that she loves him a lot , so I never thought that things could turn like this .
Dear Sir/Madam .
Two sisters , Alex and Daniela were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking of what they could do . That year , the winter in France was very cold . It was near Christmas and the two girls had n't found any present for their mother . Offering Christmas presents was a tradition not be forgotten and only four days left . Alex suggested that it would be a good idea to go to the city to buy that present . Daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk with this kind of weather . Anyway , Alex was too stubborn to give up and it was like talking to a brick wall : she did n't listen to her sister .

I have been asked by my classmates to write to you to suggest a new activity which you could include in the London programme if you liked it .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
Anyway , do n't you think that nowadays , fashionable clothes is quite similar than 20 years ago ? It 's evident that whatever we wear look like clothes , and I think we should stop being so stupid . We ca n't wearing peculiar clothes like in science fiction films . I bet you that in 100 years , humans will wearing exactly the same clothes as today , because we love the actually fashion of clothes which is wonderful . The last survey about fashion shown that people feel really comfortable with those now !
I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING YOUR PROMPT REPLY .
The telephone is a very important invention , which has affected our lives . It is a way for people to communicate although they are at two different places . People use the telephone every day and it is one of the most important things in daily life .
. If I have to take lots of clothes or is there a service to wash them .
As I jumped off the train , I met a friend of mine . I immediately wanted to show him what I had bought to make him jealous . I took the white plastic bag and ... Oh my god ! There was no more plastic bag , I had forgotten it in the train !
To begin with , we enjoy reading gossips about famous stars and politicians , although they sometimes are n't truly . In addition we are fascinated in their marriage , children , holidays etc . What is more it was their own choice to become popular and well-known . By chosing this style of life they should realise , how their life would look like .
About the accomodation , I have no problems , but I would prefer staying in tent , so that the holiday may be more adventurous .
When you spend money on goods and services , it gives you satisfaction and happiness but going shopping is not always enjoyable . There are a few reasons .
Well , danger is in my nature an Life is nothing but an adventure .
The carbon dioxide are growing very fast and people cut more trees , therefore not enough trees to such carbon dioxide and produce oxygen .
Dear Mr. Robertson ,
You can see that you promise me I 'll have a good evening and I realy do n't have it .
A friend of mine was organising a pop concert , and as he knew me well , he asked me if I 'd like to design the clothes the pop singers would wear in the show . Of course , I accepted immediately very pleased .
Write back soon
Your faitfull .
Finally , from my point of view , I would like to receive the money that I payed because it was not the same as you offered in the advertisement .
On the other hand , other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment . They claim that it is absolutely intrusion on the privacy . What is more , they insist that before celebrities , they are also human-beings who want to live without being disturbed and watched .
Endless imagination and development of technology will lead us to future fashion .
After the show many people wanted go to your theatre restaurant , but it was closed because there someone has fixed something .
I 'm sorry I can only write now because last week I have too much work .
I would like to travel on July ; that is for me the only possibility because I will finish my course a University at the end of June and I will start to work in September .
Technology is very important in our life . Mainly , because it makes it easier and more comfortable . Nevertheless it has some advantages and drawbacks .
I can hardly await your reply !
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Yours sincerely
Fainally I would like to ask you about I have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how is the weather over there on July because I will prepare the clothes as usedful .
Later somebody told me that I had to look at the labels on the top .
How much effort and time it took about two decades go to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges ! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat , and modern coffee machines can make even cappuccino or whatever you want on their own . Those devices made our life easier like old fridges had to be defreezed to melt out and new fridges use different kind of cooling and will tell you if your forgot to close the door ! The modern cooker will turn off itself if something goes wrong ! Personally , my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to devices modern technology offers us .
The concert was absolute marvellous ! So many happy people in the crowds , that the atmosphere was infectious . Anyway , what you wanted to know was what has been my job . Actually my job was not really stressful , but I had contact and access to all the famous Pop Stars . I had to bring them refreshments . That has been my dream since my childhood .
STUDENTS SHOULD BE AWARE ABOUT WHAT 'S HAPPENING WITH THEIR LIVES ; DO N'T THEY ?
The activities are quite hard to choose really , because you have a lot of chose which is I like . But I think I will choose Basketball and Photography , because basketball is the only sport I can play well . Photography is a very interesting activitie , and is not too hard to do too .
But including only six countries in the festival does not seem enough , in my opinion . I think next year you should invite more different countries , because the festival would be more multicultural .
Have you ever asked yourself which lessons or activities should be filmed in the school video ? Well , I 've just polled some students and here are their responses .
Dear Miss Helen Ryan
I look forward to receiving your confirmation .
Yours faithfully ,
The performer , Paul , is a big music name at the present . But I 'd never met him before . This time , I saw him in person . I told him I loved his songs , he was very happy . Then , we stroke a lovely conversation . Afterwards , he gave his pen for my enthusiasm .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
Wait for a sunny day , take a look into your wardrobe , some money , ask a friend to go with you , and enjoy an exciting shopping !
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . He has a bestfriend , that was more like a brother for him . They always done thing together , and they were the most popular boys in school , both were very hanson , played football they were the example for everybody . Before one day , when Pat discovered that his brother was gay , after this their relationship has change . Pat was very frightened with this situation .
Now we should be able to answer at the introducing question . No , I do n't think so . Television has become so important for us that we ca n't thinking that it could n't exist .
Firstly I would like to travel in July only because I have two months holiday which are July and August , I choose July because it is the only one month that I think I 'm free . In August I have to work so .
The thing is we are too fashion conscious , too fussy about our appearance and we 'll end up forking out for smart clothes only because the people next door are doing so ! !
Last week I and my family had a holiday in London . At the end of a holiday we decided to go to the theatre . I insisted on going to your theatre , to the Circle Theatre , because I have heard that it is one of the best theatres in London . That days you presented , ,The over the Rainbow '' . how you have written at the advertisement : it is the London 's newest and best musical show . But I and my family had a very disappointing evening . Because , at first , at the advertisement was written that in this music show would play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but it was n't so . Danny Brook did n't play at the performance , there was another unknown actor . And he played awful , I could n't hear him . Then at the adverstisement stood that performance begin at 19.30 . I and my family came to that time and had to wait till 20:15 , because the show started only at that time . I was very nervious . What is more you wrote that discounts available , but it was also lie . After the show I was very disappointed , because I spent a lot of money for nothing and my husband decided to make me a pleasure . He suggested to have a supper in your theatre restaurant . But when we came to it , we saw that the restaurant was closed , because it was reconstructed . But why do you mention about the restaurant at the advertisement , if it is closed ? So this evening was terriable . It broke all my impression about London . And now I requere my money back . Because of nothing what was mentioned at the advertisement I did n't get .
Thank you for your letter . I was very glad I won the competition . This trip will , undoubtedly be a wonderful experience .
I suggest to film our English lessons and Math lessons . From activities I suggest to film sport lessons . and music lessons . We have very interesting English lessons . They are always funny and nice . We always learn something new . At some lessons students are always work , but us we work , joke , discuss many topics , tell some stories about our life . Students think that we do n't do anything and we do n't learn anything spessial . It 's not true . We practice our English and I think we have to film our English lessons , so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way how they do . Also Math . lessons are so interesting . Many people do n't like Math because they think that it 's boreing subject . I think it 's all depends of teacher . Our Math . teacher knows how to teach so we do n't get tired of his lessons . I think we should film the Math . lessons , so students and some teachers will change their opinion about Math . For activities we should film sport lessons because we always do something new . We do many competitions with other schools , and we always have fun . Our music lessons are speccial . We try to play on many instruments , sing even if we do n't know how . And it 's always interesting to wach others while they do something like that .
M. S .
As well as all the treasures , statue and historical paintings ... There are also restaurent 's and modern gallaries . When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat , or if you are fed up with historical thing , you migh as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern .
Yours faithfully ,
I 'm really happy to hear from you ! I 've had so much work at school recently ( exams ! ) and so many things to do , that I 've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit . Fortunately , the people from my class are really great and we all love trips - especially interesting ones .
The basic story of the book is in fact quite simple . It is about a tough old fisherman from Cuba who sails out alone in a small boat to fish . He is only aiming for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccesfull for 86 days . This day he is lucky . He get a big swordfish hooked and after a long fight the fish is finally catched .
It is one of the most popular subject in the school . Also , because this video is their project , it should be filmed .
As you know , the conference will start at 11:00 and it will finish at 13:00 , but we will have lunch altogether at 13:30 in the college 's hall until 14:30 .
Modern technology is , nowadays , not only a `` tool '' for every day life but also a lifestyle . People are getting more and more adicted to this , because helps every day life to be easier and more confortable .
Dear Kim ,
At the end of the conference , we will have a party . The party is to let all the students to know each other better . The party will be in the dance hall next to the conference room . I will suggust them to wear formal clothing , as in tie , trousers and blaser .
How has modern technology changed our daily life ?
Under the circumstances , I was asked by the class to inform you about the show and to ask if it could be possible to make some changes in the programme if it could to visit the Exhibition . It will take place on Tuesday from 10.00am to 19.00pm , so we could give up the shopping and go to the show in the afternoon .
At first , I am able to travel only in July because I will have on holiday in July , furthermore I have a important exam in November . Secondly I would prefer to stay in tent as it will be natural life while I am at the Camp . Thirdly I keen on playing tennis and taking some photography .
Suitable lessons and activities
I mean It 's still inbelivable , can you imagine that was like a dream I was checking their hands .
- Danny brook did not play and I wanted to see him .
I agree with this statement .
I hope , you will concider about my opinions and my suggestions would be helpful for the next year .
Best regards ,

Yours faithfully ,
I know that everyone is excited about what happened to Michael Douglas ' wedding or what kind of life the President of The United States is living but sometimes it 's going a bit to far .

Your group will stay at the Palace Hotel . The Palace Hotel is situated in the town centre next to the railway station . A free shuttel-bus gets you to the conference-center . The bus leavs at 8 a.m. at the front entrance of the hotel .
I wanted to thank you for allowing us to have this great opportunity to visiting London .
But the unpredicted was that I actually got to meet Maddy , and talk to her for almost one hour ! The Material girl 's the sweetest person in the world , totally unlike the media says . Mo ' told me everything about her new album , `` Music '' , and how the single with the same name had slipped into the Internet in the UP3 format . She sang to me part of the album 's second single , `` How it feels like for a girl '' !
Now let 's start whith shopping at Beverley Center . Beverley Center area is the place that the teenager like to go shopping the most . But some teenager like to go to Bolton-Market . Because every one have different thinking like beverley center if you there every day or every week for a shopping you well get very boring because some time is to much people every where like in the resturant and shops . It 's make you feel want to go home . And about the traffic some times it makes you feel do n't want to go out because of the traffic . And if you never know money or you have less money shopping is not enjoyable for you I'am choue . And shopping in the market is one think that I ' am not going to do . Because all the smell in the market is alfrell is the smell of the meat and durty water black and smely water all over the market street . I think of it it 's make my shopping enjoyable . And that 's why some time shopping is enjoyable . Because the place and people .
Thank you for your attention . I am looking forward to hearing from you .
I am very glad to hear from you that I have won the first prize in your competition . I would like to reply and ask you some questions .
Finally , I am going to write about the theater , the Circle Theatre . The show supposed to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 . Because of that , we missed the train and we had to stay one more night in London . It was your responsibility . We would like you to pay back the fee of the show and pay us that hotel 's fee as well . I would recommend you to show that the restaurant is closed on Monday . I could not have dinner .
Listen to the radio if you want to know how it ends .
A veteran fisher takes his boat and goes fishing to convine himself and other mans that he is still able to do that . Then , Hemingway paints a marvellous description of fishing act and of the great fight between the fish and the old man . The 24-hour fight is described in a so peacful , faithful way that it callas a though about life and death . I recommand this book a lot both to discover Hemingway and american litterature .
According to your advertisement , Danny Brook was involved in the show , but to my disappointment there was a different actor . To make things worse , the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 . Besides , there was a problem with tickets . According to the advertisement , discounts were available , but in reality it was n't so ! On top of everything , when I decided to visit your theatre restaurant after the show , it turned out to be closed . When I insisted on the explanation of this fact , I was told that the chief cook was on holiday !
The end-of-conference party is going to start from Seven o'clock . One of our teacher , who will be voted by student is making speech for one hour . After , student is making speech about what he or she have learned . and diner . In my opinion , you should wear normal cloth . I would like to suggest that you should visit building of sixty two which is consisted on sixty second floor . There are eye-max cinema , museums , garelty . This is very famous in our city .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
How has modern technology changed our daily life ? Of course , our life will be completely changed . However , we have to consider about our nature and human-being .
Yours sincerely
On the other hand there are some disadvantages . For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world , which computers create . Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people 's labour , which leads to the increasing of unemployment .
Morning Lessons : Although there are a lot of classes , there is special FCE class in which students are being prepared for FCE exam . There are special methods and materials for students .
Pat , to win her new classemates ' friendship tell all what she knew about her friends and owing to what Pat said , her friends broke they friendship with Pat because their popularity was damaged .
YOURS SINCERELY .
In my opinion technology have made human life easily , funier and more comfortable .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
I arrived in Paris for New Years Eve 2000 without a place to stay , not speaking any French , alone and with a little amount of money . But eventhough all of these desadventages above , I was folling my dreams and objectives and inspite of everything I was going to do it .
The list of activities that you have is very interesting so my choice was very difficult to make but I have finally decided to chose sailing because I have been sailing for five years now and enjoy it very much . My second choice is climbing because I have never climbed and would like to have a go at it .
Some people went to help him , and then realised that it was not true . They were angry . He did it more times , and at last nobody cared of the shoutings .
Fathermore , discounts was unavailable . Even though we had a student card . In the advertisement they said that tickets discounts available . I think it a bombastic . Anyway I was so unpleasement . It was not marvellous evening . Could you back my money please ? You have responsoiblity for the audiences .
First I would like to say that doing a video about daily life at our school is great idea . Some people may think that school is boring and nothing interesting ever happens there . I hope that after seeing this video most people will change their view on that topic . To make that happen , we have to find some interesting activities to film .
Dear Madame ,
I am understud from your letter , what all accommodation and travel costs are paid for me , including transport to and from the airport .
( Your English class N3c )
If you need more information , please do not hesitate on writing me .
I had a problem with my best friend once when we keep in tuch through e-mail . The problem is the language , we used English but we both were not very good at it by the time which made us misunderstand each other . However , the problem solved by a telephone . We are now still friend . Thanks to the invention of the telephone .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . This feature did n't allow you to tell him much about yourself . He was n't really wicked , he merely did n't understand to keep his mouth shut , especially at school where every little unimportant thing about your so called `` private life '' runs three laps around the schoolyard before you learn it although you are the most concerned about it and did n't even know .
About accommodation , I would prefer a tent because I have never slept in the tent and I would like to try it . It will be very interesting for me because normaly I have not a lot of time to do activities . I would prefer swimming because I very like it and I am trying to swim anywhen I have got some time , and painting because I have finished painting course and I have some practice with this .
I talked to them and to many other groups that arrived later .
Dear Mr. Helen :
Yours faightfully
As more people like dance shows , me too . That 's the real knowledge for us , art exhibition and talks by writers . I think we know a writer life or how is he writing it ? it 's very significant thing . Lastly , you said 'one reasonable-priced weekend ticket for all events ' . It 's excellent . If you can pay attention to my small suggestion , next year I hope it will be unbelievable festival .
`` It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it . '' Nowadays I remember those exciting days in which danger is knocking at your door every day . It was 20 years ago we were friends since 10 . In those days we decide to be friends forever and work for the NASA .

Shopping is not always enjoyable
I would like to know if there is a medical staff present during the two weeks ? Does any medication have to be declared to them ? In case of any accidents , will the transport back home be paid for ?
Secondly , the plays and movies were marvellous . However , I was disappointed by the number of that . It will be great if there were would have more choice the next year . I would like to give you a suggestion about the space in the concert rooms . Considering the crowded , it should have more rooms . Finally , I will be interested in meet artists from everywhere in the world not only Europeen artists .
I would be glad if you consider my suggestions .
When I saw your advertisement on yesterday 's newspaper , I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you have written on your advertisement . But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I look forward to hearing from you .
Write me as soon as possible .
Hey , guess what : I gave a hand to a friend at a pop concert !
To sum up , there is no problem without a solution and if you are an active and broad-minded person , you will surely find a way to earn money even in Arctic .
My first task was to open the doors to let in all the fans of Britney Spears . I stood at the entry and theire I had to check the tickets . Two girls came together and they wanted to go in with only one ticket for both ! I had to tell one of them , that she had to leave . She started crying . Such a poor girl . At this moment I did n't like my position .
Dec. 16th , 2000
First of all , I would prefer travelling during the month of July , because I have already booked a holiday with my cousins in August .
How are you ? I am fine . Remember I have told you that I have been selected to help at a pop concert of a local band ? Well , it turned out really well and everybody had a great time .
I look forward to hearing from you soon ,
It was the last time I trusted in Pat .
4 . Canteen . Everyday we go to canteen have lunch , no matter you bought food from there or you take your own food .
I was having a week 's holiday in London when I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical show . I had read your advertisement in a morning newspaper and the show seemed very attractive to me . Moreover an English friend of mine had told me that it would purely be a good show as Danny Brook was a very good actor .
17th June 2000
Yours faithfully
FINALLY I COULD N'T EAT TOO . IN FACT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED , VERY FAR FROM MY THOUGHTS .
I think the people will wear convenient clothes with simple design in the future . Because the people will stay at home more than now with their computer . And they will use soft cozy cloths like cotton and silk .
The plays and films were really wonderful , people liked them very much , so could you play more next year
IN MY OPINION FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS THAT IN SOME CASS , COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
ON THE OTHER HAND WE THOUGHT TO VISIT THE THEATRE RESTAURANT BUT IT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE THE MUSICAL SHOW DID N'T BEGIN AT 19:30 AS WE COULD READ IN THE ADVERTISEMENT IT BEGAN AT 20:15 .
Of course there is also a big disadvantage .
Dear Mr Jones ,
Our school basketball team is one of the best teenagers team in our city , and every afternoon students are all play basketball in playground . So , basketball should be filmed .
Yours sincerely
Hello Sir ,
Finally , could you give me your suggestion about money and clothes . What kind of clothes are suitable to take with me and could I have any benefit from you for my trip or not . Could you please send me more information about this .
I 'm always very busy traveling from one country to another , you know .
Dear Mr Smith ,
Yours sincerely
Yours faithfully
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Shin Parade
I am writing to draw your attention to the musical show that was place last evening . None of conditions was fulfilled : firstly , Danny Brook , who was going to perform in the show , was changed by another actor . As a result it was a disappointing performance . Furthermore , the show started at 20:15 while the advertisment said that it was going to begin at 19:30 .
Dear Mr. Robertson ,
Lots of love ,
I am glad to provide all information
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
Yours sincerely ,
It 's a big advantage to go shopping with a friend , because he or she can bring you all the clothes in a suitable size if the one you took does n't fit . Often it happens that the salesman has n't got the size you need and that 's always a pity .
Nowadays , most people think that famous people have a so good life ( lots of money , comfortable house ) that they have to stop complaining about he media 's treatment , because they have chosen to have this kind of life .
Yours sincerely
For the women , too . If they ca n't find things which they expected , they go there just only to get tired .
Secondly , I would like to stay in a log cabin because I think they 're more comfortable than the tents , also because I do n't like to sleep in tents very much , I think they 're very cold during the night
Dear Sir ,
I am writing to reply on your letter concerned about the holidays at Camp California in the U.SA as a first prize in the competition which I fortunately won last month .
On the positive side , if I am bored , the first thing that I want to do is watching television or listening to music . Or if I want to go shopping or to another city , it is necessary to use the car or the public transport .
Wapons were designed to kill and defences in a fright , in War 1945 so many German were killed , also many people die from other region . e.g . The Englishs .
I would like to know some more information about the Camp , before I left , which clothes are more appropriate and how much money should I take with me .
Dear Ms Ryan
According to your activities at the Camp , I would choose singing and painting because I am a lead singer in the university band and I think I will be good at this activity . Also painting is my hobby because I have always been painting when I have a spare time . I would be grateful if you could tell me some details about what type of clothes and How much money I should bring .
I have received your letter : I was very glad to know that I have won two weeks at Camp California . I have to take part in basketball competitions all year long , except during July , so it is the only month in which I can travel . I would be grateful if I could have the accomodation in a log cabin : I would prefer not to stay in a tent because of my height , I am so tall that I could never stand up . I would like to play basketball because my trainer said that it would be suitable not to stop practising it during July . I can play basketball very well I would be grateful if you could teach me to play golf . I have never practised this sport , so I ca n't play golf at all .
I am writing to thank for noticing me about the competition and I would be very grateful in giving to you the information was requiered in your letter .
yours faithfully
I am writing to you to complain about my unpleasant experience of visiting your theatre on May 21st . I had dreamt about visiting the Circle Theatre to see Danny Brook 's performance for a long time . As soon as I saw your advertisement in the 'Tourist Guide ' issue 46 , I decided to go at once .
International Arts Festival
Yours sincerely
Furthermore , we have been informed that students are allowed to see this exhibition without paying money . This event takes place in Central Exhibition Hall in London , on Tuesday on 14th of March .
In conclusion , if you want to earn a bit of money , then you have to choose proper part-time job . Because you will get some money as well as some career and knowledge . You must consider the purpose too . If you have n't purpose , you would waste money easily and quickly .
I drove to Ouchy where I took a drink . It was so hot , I decided to go for a swim in tutry , although I had n't any swimming-clothes . I knew a good place . I parked the car and went ten minuts . As I had planed , the place was deserted . I took my clothes of and swam twenty minutes in the lake . Coming back , I noticed that my clothes were missing . I walked back , hoping I would n't come accross anyone and be able to drive back home . The car was missing too .
This is my opinion of the Home of the Future and I wish I could live in it .
Another point which I think was ennoying , are the concert halls . The concerts were great but the hall was too small for so much people I hope that next year the concerts will take place in a bigger hall .
Well this is abosolutly true , espacially when you go shopping on Saturday . Everyone goes shopping on Saturday so the mall is always crowed , and most of the people are stressed , it 's crazy . For exemple you go into a cloth shop , you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that would fit their new skirt , so they are looking every where , pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want . And then they have and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you choose . And you have to wait after to buy it , so finally you waited so long that you are getting late , so you get stressed to . So it 's really not enjoyable to go shopping . Plus most of the time , you see all those mothers looking after their kids , and yelling their name 's kids into the shopping mall because they lost them . So you are getting a headache because you hear the kids crying , the mothers yelling , if I can give you an advice : DO N'T GO SHOPPING ON SATURDAY ! ! You get headaches , you get stressed , and finally you get bruses because of the woman that pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you ! ! !
Yours sincerely .
That all I would like to recommend you . It would be greatful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us about your decision as soon as possible .
Yours
Firstly , the conference will take place in the Palace Hotel and we get from our college to there by bus . Number 45 bus runs to there every 5 minutes . It takes 25 minutes that is convenient to us . Secondly , there are some programme that are very great . First time , the conference 's head make a short speech and then we have dinner and drinks . Finally we enjoy a disco party so you wear a suiteable dress .
Yours faithfully
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I think modern technology has changed my daily life , especially in communication with my best friend who is studying in Britain .
Henri
For me the most important thing is the telephone because without this you ca n't do anything , it 's part of my life .
Thank you for the letter you wrote to me to inform me about the prize I won . I was so happy ! I could n't believe it .
Shopping is not always enjoyable
Many bosses or in the factories not being needed to employ many claver workers Because we do n't need them a lot . This saves a lot money for companies .
Apart from that , the advertisement mention that there were discounts available , and there were not . It mention that visitors could visit the restaurant after the show , too , and we could not because it was closed , and the person who was there said that it was very late and he was not allowed to open the restaurant for us .
Phat Cheung
Usually I go to a restaurant after theatre but this was also not possible because your theatre restaurant was closed because of holiday . Why do you give those information in an advertisment .
Finally , I should say that I had a very good time in spite of the flaws and I would like to thank you for it . I wish to enjoy an even better festival next year .
Mrs. Helen Ryan
Would you consider to give my money back ? If the refund is available , it would be grateful .
If I pick up the example , Kimono ( Japanese traditional cloth ) will wear on not only Japan but also another countries in generally .
When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and tersty .
Cambridge , 13th June 2000
I liked all the stars and the artists who came from around the world , even if the number of countries was very little , only six . Why do n't you let more countries to participate next year ?
My name is Yakimo Nashoto , I study in France and I went to London just to see `` Over the Rainbow '' because all my friends told me that it was `` great '' . However , when I saw it , I was really disapointed and I ask you some money back . The reasons why I was disappointed were :
Yours faithfully ,
Yours sincerely ,
For the time that I would like to travel must be on July only . This is because my A-levels exams is coming up so I really need times to revise , and July is the only month and time that I am free .
Dear Elinor ,
At Camp California , I would preferably like to stay in a tent as I think it would be more enjoyable .
17 October 2000
Recommendations
To sum up I would say that even when shopping is not always enjoyable we have to do it because we do not have another option .
Also it means to meet other people , to have fun together , to travel at all the places of the island . I think that the summer makes people to feel great , to have fun , to enjoy themselves . I believe that the summer is a season for everybody who wants to have wonderful time and wonderful memories wherever the go .
To conclude , while our homes in the future will be much safer than before , they will still have good spaces for us to be at home .
To the manager of the Circle Theatre .
I remember these time in our class when us talking many time about rules and I am missing that time so much .
When we arrived at the theatre we had to realise that there were no discountable tickets available as mentioned in your advertisment so we had to buy the most expensive ones . After that one of the theatre assistants told us that the film would have began at 20:15 o'clock instead of 19:30 o'clock as indicated . So we had to arrest for a while and had a drink .
I look forward to hear news from you .
Firstly , I expected to see Danny Brook in the show , but he was replaced by another actor . Why was he not here ?
Because of all these reasons , which I have listed above , my evening which should have been perfect , turned into a disaster . So I would like to have at least some of my money back as soon as possible .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I think one possibility is to buy your things on the internet , because then you have not to invest a lot of time for buying all this things , and they bring you the things at home In the end I think it is the best if you have the possibility to shop when there are not so many people because then you have enough time and you are not stressed .
Dear Maria Smith ,
Hunting on the High Street , or the Shopping Malls , for the desired bargain - because we cant afford otherwise to buy - becomes often a desperate atempt to reach a living promoted by the new consuming society . And nobody can say they would rather go back to the caverns ' age where money was not even invented .
I decided to do something to this man , my first move was to check was there any solid or liquid which could blocked his breathe . And checking his body condition . After that I turned on the car light in order to tell the passing cars .
I am very glad to help you about the International Student Conference . I hope that our friend Richard Brown does n't have any serious willness .
I am really surprise for the information because I won , and I like to tell you thank you for everyting this is why I wrote and send this letter with the information you need , only I can travel in July because it is the only time with I can do it before for my work , really I do not care which accommodation will I can have , I am prefer the accommodation in July I will be avaliabel for the moment , I am really apreciated if you can tell to the people who work in Camp California , I choose the Golf and Photography because I think I am really interesting in that object I am no really really good but I have some of studies . I would like to ask you what kind of clothes I need to take for the place and for the weather follow for the money , how much money I need to take ? I think it is everyting I like to know . Thank you very much for you time .
As you know last month I went to help at a concert , the one that I told you in my last letter . I wanted to go very much there and so go there for helping was for me a unique chance . Moreover instead of bying a ticket I entered there for free , as a helper .
You ca n't lose the chance to see this castle because it is an excellent view and always there are a lot of people there and there are little shops where you can buy souvenirs .
Nevertheless , new technology has made me become more lazy . I spend a lot of free time watching TV , or surfing on the Internet or playing the computer . Maybe it change me into a kind of self-centered person , a loner .
In your last letter said that you want to know about my experience at the pop concert . I enjoy it very much , it was great ! There I helped with the special effects and the sound . They liked me so much and invited me to be the responsable with lights and sound . I told then that I will think about it but I belive I will accept the job .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Dear Mr Robertson ,
FINALLY , I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU LET ME KNOW IF I WILL HAVE TO TAKE SOME CLOTHE OR MONEY . I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF I WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY OTHER EXTRA ACTIVITY .
Otto Zajac .
ONE MORE THIN THAT IS OF MY CONCERN AND YOU DID N'T MENTION . I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF IT 'S NECESARY TO TAKE MONEY , FOOD AND CLOTHES WITH ME .
The queue is not only the problem if you go by car there is parking problem , if you go by bus there is again queue and you have to carry many carry bag carrier bags during the your journey and you wo n't be alway luky to find a seat to seat .
Yours
About accommodation , I would prefer to stay in tents because it will be a new experience for me . I like to get new experiences specially when I am on holiday .
Conclusion
In the end I was happy that I had done this job . It was really a wonderful day .
We have more researchers than some years ago and we will be able to find the solution of lots of problems . Actually , we can cure illness which were very dangerous before . I 'm sure that in a couple of years we will see cured some illness like cancer , UTH .
Dear Helen Ryan
I have never work without a computer , but if we had n't any we would it find normally .
Moreover , despite there were some restaurants in the theatre , they had already closed because it was too late , I wanted to have a coffee but I could not .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good a keeping secrets . That night my parents went out , so I had to stay home with Pat . I invited my best friends , and I asked Christian to bring some videos . We left Pat in her room with those videos , and we went to the top of the house , the third floor .
In my life , I use electricity in many different ways . At night , I can study because of it . and also It saves my time which would be used up for doing housework such as laundry , cleaning rooms and ironing . It makes my life more convenient than that without it .
Lots of kisses and hugs
I am writing to tell you something about the three-day trip to London .
This is a great opportunity because as you know most people of our class are going to work in this sector so it will be very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education .
I bought the ticket for the evening performance to end the day with a nice musical . But the time was n't kept . I had to wait 45mins to get in ! So in order to keep myself occupied for a while , I went to the restaurant except it was n't open . I could n't see anyone inside either . No one .
Science and Technology is a theme very discussed nowdays , most of the comunity of our city , and of the world , were technology has arrived , confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life . And I think it 's the same to me , because when advances in technology like computers , internet , etc . were made , it changed my life as a high school student .
Here we have a lot of beautiful things to do , but the best you can do in about three hours is visiting the painting museum .
In the 21st century , people will all the wearing the same clothes , the same shoes , they will be buying the same accessories . We 'll get out in the morning and find out that our neighbour wears our same jacket and he 's boasting about a pair of shoes which are too similar to ours .
After school Larry and I went to the cinema , but on the enterance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us . Larry told me that she is his girlfriend and then I told them I had to go home . When they asked me the reason I told that I promised my Mom to be with her . They said OK and I went home . When I closed my bedroom 's door I burst into tears . I do n't know how long I cried ...
Shopping is not always enjouable because of several factorors .
Everyone has likes and dislikes . But noone is doing what he likes all the time . There is times that you have to do something even if you do n't like it , and times that you are doing what you like but not the time you like it . What I 'm trying to say is that I like to shop but I ca n't do that all the time . First because I 'm not so rich and second because I do n't enjoy to shop all the time . Nothing in life is always enjoyable even the things we enjoy to do , and that 's how life is . You say you enjoy shopping I understand but life goes on you ca n't do the same things every day . live your life and try to do different things and you will see that to do different things is exciting and more fun . You do n't have to be bored with the same old things .
I was very disappointed . In addition the concert did n't start on time . It was quarter of an hour late . If I knew that the show was going to be late , I would ask my mom to come with me , because her working hour ended at eight o'clock . The restaurant was closed after the show ended . On the other hand there were no discounts available , as a result I had to paid extra money for the tickets .
Once again congratulations on the Festival .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisment about a fashion and leisure show in London . it will be on the 14th and we all want to go . So , it would be greatful if you can give us this opportunity to watch the show .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Ms Ryan
First of all , thank you for your good programme . We saw your details and enjoyed them . Especially River trip to Greenwich and visiting National Art Gallery .
Manuel P. Martinez
The reality was Marine 's parents are not her real parents , they found her in their houses garden . They try so many things to find her family for one year they did everything to find her family but they could n't find . In this one year they spend most of their time with Marine and they loved her so much and they want to be her parents . When Marine was three years old a man came to their house and sad that he is Marine 's father and wont to take her . and he added that he leave Marine because her mother was dead two days after Marine 's birth . and the police thought Marine 's father did this so they put him on prison he had nobody that he can give marry so he leave her on their garden . The Marine 's real father want her back but the other cuples did n't want to give her because they loved Marine so much . They give a lot of money to Marine 's real father to take her . After that Marine 's father take the money & left her . The cuples could n't say the reality to Marine because they were afraid of losing her .
Secondly , in your advertisement the time of the show was 19:30 and in reallity the show has started at 20:15 and the discount was not available .
Are there anything wondering happen over there ? Please write me when you have time . I am looking forwards to hearing from you .
I 'm a good swimmer and I would like to do it in the Californian See . I do n't think I 'll have the chance of doing it again in the future .
Also , I was asking too many people in the street . Could you live without telephone ? The answer was all the same `` Imposible '' . An old woman told me how important was the phone when her only son was abroad studing computers in the `` Chicago University '' , she told me that every night was expecting a call from her son , for her was the line of the hapiness .
Of course , I could enjoy this concert , as well
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . Last Wednesday Carole received a letter . The stamp was from a foreign country and the address was written in Capital Letters . She did n't recognize the writing . She began to read `` Dear Carolin.. There was only a person who used to call her by this name . It brought a lot of memories back to her . It was long time ago , when she was fourteen and Paul sixteen . He was her first love and also the first who kissed her . Paul had to move to Mexico because of his father 's work . When they were saying goodbye Paul `` I will be the last person who will kiss you '' . `` It sounds nice but I do n't believe it '' she replied . `` You only have to wait '' he said . But she did n't wait . She got married and had two children . At this moment Carole was living with her husband but they did n't love each other any more . Their love had finished . In his letter Paul said that he had become a rich man and he would come back to meet her again . Her friend Pat had explained the whole story at her husband . What she would do ?
According to your advertisement , the actor should be Danny Brook , but infact it was different person . My ticket was for 19.30 , but it started very late , it started 20:15 . When the show finished , it was too late to catch the train to home . I had to take taxi . It costed me £30 . `` What a waste ! , , By the way , I did n't see any discounts for buying tickets . One more thing , the theatre restaurant was closed when I get there for a glass of drink , I do n't know why , there was no written notes or information about that . I am not sure that I did have a perfect evening out .
Your faithfully
Therefore I ask you to give use £20 back , because the two tickets were not more worth . I 'm looking forward to hearing soon from you .
EXPLAIN
I hope I have n't been too `` demanding '' .
Dear manager ,
Do famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time ?
We should n't disregard and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college , especially when we take into our consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespear . It will be a good advertising , and will help to make the reputation of our college even more better .
Faithfully yours ,
I am very glad to hear that I have won first prize in your competition . Here are some further information you need from me :

But if I have n't got enough money to spend or if I am sad shopping is not always enjoyable , because without money and sad is not a good idea to go to shopping .
Yours sincerely
Helen Ryan
As a child , I would be taken to the mall and be forced to go through all the shops and establishments just to please my mother , whose desire to buy , without any sort of control , all kinds of clothes and gadgets was something unbelievable . And due to these bizarre situations I went through as a little boy , everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I 'm forced to drink .
Dear sir or madam ,
Besides that the most importand is that this children have an easy teenaties and they have n't go pshycological problems and they are useful in sociaty .
First of all , I am a student and would like to travel in July . Because I intend to take examination in Septenber . So I can afford to go on holiday only in July . Secondly , I would prefer to stay at log cabins rather than tents . It will be my first time to experience to stay there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried .
First , I am able to come only in July , because my examination session is due from the 24 June till 26 June .
Moreover , the stars and artists were only from six countries , In my opinion , if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries , it will make the festival more exciting , more intesting , and from my point of view , some concert halls were too small , the people in there could n't even go to the loo ! because it was too crowed . Finally , the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed , as far as I 'm concerned . If you can show more play and films It will achieve a good effect .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
On the other hand there are some disadvantages . for example if you are a working mother with three children , that means you are always n a hurry , going shopping is really unenjoyable . You go shopping in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue .
13th June 2000
In addition it is properly to mention you that all the students of my class are interested in going to The London Fashion and Leisure show , which is taking place on Tuesday 14th in the Central Exhibition Hall .
Always more people , everywhere , are becoming shopping-addicts . Maybe you can think I am excessive but recent studies prouves that this mania can be really dangerous .
Yours sincerely ,
Nowadays especially in the west area of the world science and technology have done great , enormous steps in directions of the progress . Not only for the great nations , but also for every their inhabitants .

Dear Miss Ryan ,
Yours sincerely ,
At first it was a great plessure for me to get a ticket therefor becauses I 'm one of the greatest fan of Danny Brook . It 's not that problem that there was no more discount available - but I had choosen it , because I 'm ( alowed ? ) .
After the show I went to visit the restaurant as it is said it is very famous and apart from that I wanted to have a drink . At the end I had to go home as it was closed because the coffee pot did not work . What nonsense !
Firstly , it 's written that it will be played by Danny Brook , but in fact it was n't . I was very disappointed when I saw someone I 've never heard about it . In addition to this , the timetable 19.30 was n't correct . We 've lost our time waiting outside in the cold that the doors would get opened 45 minutes later .
I am interested in tennis but I am not so good tennis player . However I would like to attend tennis activity . In addition swimming would be good activity for me . While I was studying at the high school and the university , I was in the swimming team of the school .
The activities you offer are really interesting . I would like to take part in a painting course and I would like to get to know how to handle a camera .
We would be very grateful if you could change our programme for Tuesday afternoon . We are thinking here particularly of the fact , that we can go to the show , instead of shopping .
Dear Kim ,

At my school , we are n't allowed to smoke inside the building , because the building is made of wood , it tend to catch fire easily , and we are n't allowed to use Internet , there are only ten computers in the school , only teachers can use it , if we used , we would be sent to the head office of the school .
Dear Mrs Helen Ryan ,
Seeing that this is the first year of the drama lessons , it is not very well known . Also they are showing their first play on the 2nd of July . Part of the show can be filmed .
The job was hard , but from my point of view , it was worthful . I have learned lots of things , earned some money for the summer , and the most important thing : I have had fun .

In our lyceum we have listem of `` double lessons '' . It means that every day exept Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for hour and a half and it means `` double lesson '' . I think that is more convinient than seven lessons every day and each of the lessons lasts fourty five minutes . It is convinient , I mean `` double '' lessons because you have more time to understand matherial what is givven and because you have to prepare only four subjects for `` tomorrow '' and it is less then seven subjects .
I am writing concerning the journey I have won in your competition .
Conclusion .
The only problem is that the show is going to take place on tuesday of 14th March , so I 'm wondering if you can make some changes in your programme . My class think that it is a great opportunity for them to see the show , because tuesday is the last day that the show is going to be showed .
On the one hand technology has made our lives more comfortable and easier . On the other hand we have faced some problems , such as social and environmental problems .
Dear Mrs Smith , Hello Maria . In this letter you will get all the information that you need .
However , there was something good to me . I saw a lot of singers and entertainers . I did n't need to pay enterence fee because I was working there .
See you soon
Can you say me which cloths I take away for two weeks . Which kind of weather have you in this time .
But , the principal reason of this letter is to ask for some money back . I think that could be the best for everyone , and I 'll like to give you an advice , if somebody pay you for a ticket , try to give the best you can .
So , the show was not good at all and my evening was spoiled in spite of all that advertisement promissed . As things went that way , I want my money back .
Many people , especially women , love shopping . If you go to the centre of every big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat . But shopping is not always enjoyable .
See you soon ,
I 'm looking forward to receiving your prompt replay .
After that I prepared the group . I done mace-up for them . I was very happy because on this time I had a chance talking to them and to know more about them . They are very nice people even Audrey who seems very stupid . She is very intelligent . I really do n't know why she behave herself so badly during her interview . I got their address so we can visit them one day .
That 's when she showed me my wallet and said she had found it on the sit of the eating-place of the shopping center that I went that day !
Actually I did n't use to enjoy pop music much . My classmate Cecilia persuaded me to try whole new experience of helping at a pop concert . I thought it would be the last thing I wanted , but it was n't . I 've really enjoyed this opportunity . We delivered so many fantastic and gorgeous costumes which had been designed exclusively by top designers . We also helped to make posters and leaflets , which I enjoyed most as I always like drawing and designing .
Dear Sir/Madam , I am writing to you to complain about the musical show I went to see last Wednesday . I was told I would have the most perfect evening in London , but it was not . When I bought my ticket I expected to be able to take advantage of those discounts you announced in the newspaper advertisement but when I had to pay the most expensive price . I went to see the performance at 19:30 but it did not start until 20:15 ! I was really angry but I wanted to see Danny Brook . My surprise was when , instead of Mr. Brook , a different actor appeared on stage . At the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but when I arrived I realized it was closed because the musical show had finished too late ! All I am asking for is a full refund of the money I spent in the musical . I look forward to hearing from you . Yours faithfully ,
Firstly , on Monday morning we can visit the presentation of the latest fashions and in the afternoon we could take a sightseeing by bus . Secondly , on Tuesday morning we can watch the Leisure and Sports wear and in the afternoon we can go to the Science Museum and finally , on Wednesday , we can go and see the presentation of different hairstyles and makes up spending the afternoon in the National Art Gallery .
Yous sincerelly ,
Dear Kim ,
Counting pros and cons , I tend to think that there are more positive points in working out and manufacturing new technologies than negative ones anyway . Modern girl or boy already would not be able to imagine life without them .
Dear Kim ,
Anyway , in my country , generally , children are free at home , but it also depends on their parents . For me , I do n't have rules at home , just do n't take trouble to my family , that 's all .
Dir Madam
Secondly , the show should have started at 19:30 p.m. , and it began fourty-five minutes later .
To sump up , I ca n't think about how my life would be without technology .
I can only travel on July because these is the mounth when I have holidays . I 've already talked to my manager , and she said that that 's the only mounth I can have my holidays .
Pat could n't resist herself and told her brother Jacob , he was quite shocked about the news because , he missunderstood . He understood that 'Carlotta wants to kill Charles but she is still thinking about it . ' Jacob runs as fast as sound to get to Charles 's house . There , Jacob aproaches to him slowly and tells him .
I always had consider myself been very looky to be born in the Century because all the amaizing human inventions .
Write me back soon and tell me about your impression ( I mean if you enjoyed the story or not ! )
Last month , Alice and her friends proposed me to help at a pop concert . The group which was singing was very famous and I was able to meet them and to chat about their plans for the future .
Closing this facts , when the musical finished I was very , in the fact of the wainting for the start of the musical and dissapointed with this version of Over the Rainbow , every body went to the restaurant wich is closed without any explanation .
Maybe in 500 years , some people will live on the Mars and then , they have to wear other kind of clothes . But I do n't think this clothes are going to be a fashion on the earth . They just look funny !
Finaly the day to pay my credit card arrives and where was my money ? I started to look in everywhere . I 've asked my mom and my friends and everybody did n't know where it was . My mom said :
Brenda
What 's more , the theatre reastaurant had been closed , when the show finished . Because the show started 20:15 . It should have started at 19:30 as you said at advertisement , or you should not have closed before the show finished .
I helped at a pop concert of a newcomer group and you ca n't imagine how exciting it was !
Now what 's going to be the same . Well as I said if you 're poor , the government still give you the flat but very ugly one , probably with rats in it . The same problem will be with homeless people who does n't have money at all , even to buy a food for themselves . They will have to stay on the streets as streets is their home .
Yours sincerely ,
Secondly I think the FCE class should be filmed . Most of us ( students ) came to our school because they wanted to study English , so it should be the important part . In addition if we film the class , people can see how interesting or funny the lesson is .
Best Regards ,
Dear Mr Robertson ,
One day she invited me to her flat . Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together in weekend usally . We had a fantastic time together for three monthes . Even we could make a trip to Paris in the school holiday ! We had many common interests in music , art and books .
Thank you very much for your letter . I 'm very surprise , to won this prize . About the information , I like to travel on July because it 's only the month I have vacation . It 's very difficult to change it . About the accommodation at Camp California I will prefer tents because I like the nature and I like to listen the birds . At the camp I will like to practise tennis and golf . My level in this two activities is medium , I never practise them all . I would like to ask you some question .
Dear Mrs Ryan
What I would like to know about what kinds of clothes are suit the season in the U.S.A and how much money do I should bring the camp .
Could you please tell me for what sort of clothes do I need and how much money to take .
I never did surfing , but every time I see surfing on television I find this magic .
The price of ticket was another problem . Your advertisement says 'discounts available ' but it was not available . I did not get discount . I really liked your idea of visiting your theatre restaurant , but because of the late start of the show , the restaurant was closed by the end of the show .
Sincerely yours ,
In my opinion my daily life is full of modern technology . I meet her `` at every corner '' : at home , at school , in the backyard and so on . It also changed my life-style for better - I think . Every morning I use a toaster to have my sandwiches done , washing machine which makes my clothes clean again . Recently , modern technology means : mobile phones , computers , internet , super-fast cars etc . These improvements helps me with my ordinary dutes . I can do my homework on computer , prepare for the class test by searching information in Internet and use a mobile phone every time when I want to connect with one of my parents .
And the last question I have -
Society has to go forword not to stop on one place .
Also , the times printed on your advertisment was 14.30 and 19:30 . I went to the 19:30 show , but it did not start until it was 20:15 . I had my evening planned out and I was not pleased that the show started forty-five minutes late .
Anyway , we 'll give up wearing fur coats as it is cruel and uncivilised .
Thank you for chance to do two activities . I would like to choose Tennis and Photography . I play tennis since I was ten years of age . In my opinion tennis is the best sport I have ever plaed . Another activity what I have chosen is photography . I have just finished profesional photographer course and I would like to continiew my education in this activity .
Very soon , Lise understood that it was useless to continue pretending that she knew nothing about it , and decided to make a deal with her class mates . She would give them the exam 's questions and they would make all her homeworks during 3 weeks .
When we saw your advertisment for the musical show , over the rainbow , we immediatly decided that this must be a perfect evening out . There was in our opinion two reasons for that , our favourite actor Danny Brook and the opportunity to visit your theatre restaurant afterwords .
While we worked at the office , there are the computer and equipment for help to work and easy , after we have finished work , we come back home , there are television for get information , news , data by different way and quickly .
Many people think that it is natural for famous people to be followed by journalists all the time because they are famous and everybody is curious about their life . However , in my opinion , famous people , such as politicians and film actors , deserve to have a private life .
Thanks for your programme , we are all looking forwards especially for the Monday 13 March because we will discover all the monument in London .
Some people think that they should . They are human beings actually and they need to keep a little bit of pirvacity and freedom in their lifes to continue like normal people , to feel that they are unknown and anonymus and they do not have to wear sunglasses , hats or caps every time they want to go out home not to be recognised..
I send you some pictures , the best ones because there were some quite embarrasing .
This is why for all of those good reasons I am asking for some money back .
Everyone will not walk on roads . They will bounced on roads with there balloon clothes .
I would like some kind of explanation and receive my money back . If you do n't agree , I will act consequently .
I am really made and I want my money back , please call me to the number 23456789 , I will be waiting your call . Thank for your time
Now , I would like to request some information about clothes and money . What type of clothes and how much money should I take with me ?
I am in doupt which kind of clothes I have to bring with me . And also ask you , how much money I have to take with me .
Yours sincerely ,
Your really unsatisfied costomer
Some weeks later when Pat was walking to school she met Sally , which just came out of Paul 's house . Now Pat realized what was going on and could undstand why her boyfriend got so nervous about the secret . He was Sally 's lover !
What type of clothes I should bring with me ? and is there any equipment I need to bring with me . I would like to know how much money I need to spend during a camping .
Madam ,
During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows in the `` Circle Theatre '' . The show was called `` Over the rainbow '' and should be , in refer to the advertisment , London 's newest and best musical show . But I was very disappointed . I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the advertisment were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . When I saw that you had changed Danny Brook to someone else I was very disappointed .
Yours sincerly ,
Victoire
If we compare a person who lived a very long time ago with another one who lives now , we will see a very big difference between their clothes .
If looking after children does n't fit you , you can try with pets . Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk . So if you like animals this is your chance to earn money and have fun at the same time .
There are many facts to prove that shopping is not `` pretty and armonious '' , but believe me , is not always enjoyable .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Henri Devereux
I wait to receiving a prompt answer from you .
I look forward to replying from you .
Thank you very much for your letter . I have just received it yesterday . I am very exciting .
Finally , there are many shops inside the building . You will have a good time for shopping .
I use different technological things everyday . Such as mobile phone that helps me to communicate , with anyone in the world , even if I am not at home , I use stereo , if I want to listen to my favourite music , I use tapes , CDs , hairdryers , ect . I think that all these things made my life much easier . Many years ago people did n't have an oppotunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot . I am very happy that with all technology that we have we do n't have to work as much as they did , like to wash plates and cups after meals , my dishwashing machine will do that for me , and I do n't have to wash my clothes my washing machine does it better . Of course it is a bit sad that machinery is taking over humans and of course it makes me lazy . However now I have more freedom , free time , and privacy .
From :
The ways of transport are improving a lot this times . The cars are really useful and a lot more faster than waking or cycling . But cars created pollution : for exemple the green house effect . But it is also the technology which try to resolve this problem with new way of transport as subways or busses so as to have less cars in the cities .
I am appreciated you for offering a well-organised programme , especially , the London fashion and leisure show which is difficult for us to take part in .
As I only have holidays on July I would like to travel on this month .
On the other hand the main disadvantage is that using modern machines it can be very difficult for ederly people ; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries train people about using modern technologies .
Dear Sir ,
I see your advertisement about Internal Arts Festival now . I think that 's a great idea . As we need some good activities . Advertisement is written that you invite stars and artist from around the world . This is very incredible but from only six countries you wrote . I think you should invite from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world . If you invite from more countries to stars and artist , your festival will be unbelieved . Second point is there are some jazz , rock and classical concerts . It 's a good idea but some concert halls are too small . Because of these , people are bored quickly . You show plays and films . I congradulate you because it 's perfect . The most important thing is dance shows .
How are you ? I 'm fine . I 'm so exited . Last month I was helping at a pop concert with a few friends of mine . It was Tina Turner concert ! To this moment when I 'm thinking of it I want shout .
First of all , Danny Brook was supposed to act there , but he was replaced by another actor . This situation made me feel very disappointed .
Today I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe . Last month I received a letter which told me that I 've entered a competition . I was so happy and suprised that I first could not really believe it . But it was true . My price was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at the concert . The pop group which was going to act is called `` Metallica '' and I like their music very much ( 'cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to . ) But now to the concert itself . It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg . I started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am . First I had to help with the catering which lasted until 2 pm . After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal . The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal . I was so excited that I also was not able to eat anything . At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guiding tour for the journalists . I had to show them the way to the interviewing room . It was a bit boring but more or less okay . At 7 p.m. the first group started . They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I recognised that they are very nice . At 8 pm Metallica started and I have to tell you , they did a great performance . When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like Did you like the performance ! or How do you think about the first group ? Questions like you and I usually ask each other . You know what I mean , they were not conceited or something like this . They were like any other person and I have to admit that I like them very much . This was one of the best and most exciting days in my life .
As I told you in my last letter , last month I worked for a pop band , and helped them at a concert in Barcelona . It was such a great experience !
SUBJECT : Recomnendations of a place to visit
Yours faithfully ,
Then I realized that Danny Brook did not appear in the show which was very disappoiting for me because I like this actor very much , and I think that I was not the only one who was upset .
NOWADAYS , PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ALWAYS WORRIED . ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING , WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY IN CLOTHES .
13.06.2000
Dear Mrs Ryan :
If you do n't mind I would like to know what kind of clothes are apropriate for the camp and for the weather of California . And also may I have to bring money ? because I know that all the costs are paid but it could be necessary for other things .
At that time , I used to buy a lotery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts . One day , while I was checking my weekly ticket , I found out that I had five numbers out of six so that I would surely get a substancial amount of money .
Suggesting places to film .
Do you want to earn money ?
It seems ages since I wrote to you . How have you been ? How 's your new flat ? When I received your letter with photographs of that flat , it really looked nice . Anyway , I 'll tell you about my wonderful experience which I enjoyed at a pop concert .
In conclusion , I was n't at all satisfied , and I would like my money back since the show was n't worth it .
Yours faithfully ,
REASONS OF RECOMMENDATION .
We looking forward to hearing from you soon .
There is another thing I would know , what kind of clothes have I bring with me ? And how much money can I take with me ?
When I arrived there , I would to painting and take a photography because both of its was my hobby . I have been doing a lot of them when I have got a free time and when I feel empressted where I have been . I think I can do it very well .

If you work in a fast-food you can work in the afternoon , or during the night and so you have time for yourself .
And , there should be a electrical servant in everyone 's home . So there 's no need for people to do the household work . There should be no beds at home because some pills are invented to make people not sleepy . If you 're tire , the pill can give you vitamin , protein and make you refresh
It is main building of LUTON University at park square . There is a academic building . It inculds labrary . II suit , academic rooms a GYM Club and a restuarant .
Where the stories are concerned , they will not be difficult to understand because you already know the stories and naraitors are going to read clearly . What I 'd like to say is you should listen to them .
I would like to complain four things about your theatre . Fist thing , the actor is very horrible so I recommend you to change the actor because he will make an audience who visit you theatre disappoint .
You would n't believe how hard it was . the stage was covered with all sort of light and we made it look like a waterfall .
I 'd like to tell you about my experiences . Before that you have to think why you need to earn money and how you do that . It is really important because making money needs a proper purpose .
Dear Mr Robertson !
We are all very interested in the show because England people have a different kind of life . It is also unusual to have such a great opportunity in our country .
Shopping is not always enjoyable
First of all , I would like to travel in July because I am planning to visit my Mum in Korea in August . I also prefer staying in log cabins to tents . I have once experienced to have been soaked while I was sleeping in a tent dut to heavy rain several years ago . Once more reason is that I do not want to miss the chance to stay in a log cabin , which I have been dreaming for a long time . How romantic it will be ! As for my activities , as I took up playing golf since I was a child and now , I am a single-handicapped player , so I want to have chance to play golf at camp . Moreover , I am very good at singing as well as playing the piano . In fact I have been playing the piano for children 's choir for 5 years .
From the list of all activities I have choosen photography and golf . Since secondary school I am very interested in taking pictures and I have a big experience in it . I have choosen golf because I have never played in this game .
Thank you for your kind attention and I hope that my advices would occur useful .
I ask you if is it possible to have my money back , please , because I want to forgot that expense . Thank you .
I 've a few questions to ask . Since all accommodation and travel costs are paid for , Are there any other expenses that I have to pay ? How much money I should have with me in order to cover all other expenses ? Furthermore , what type of clothes I should bring ?
In conclusion , I was very disappointed in a whole of the show , furthermore , I could not enjoy my holiday after the show . Therefore , I would like to refund some money . I look forward to recieving your prompt reply .
For the party I suggest you to wear classic clothes ; maybe something black and not red or pink . I am going to wear black classic trousers and a white jorsey - it can be that this information give you some idea too..
Yours sincerely ,
When I am at Camp , I will choose singing and photography I can sing classic music and pop music , seem like rock & roll . Maybe TITANIC . My mum liked me singing this song . And I can also make very good photography , because I learned this in China two years ago .
Thank you for your letter which I received last week .
To answer your last question , I would propose you to attend the local zoo , because many baby animals were born in the past few days .
Yours sincerely ,
'Fashion of the Future ' ! This is not a tabu by me and my friends . We have discussed about it a lot of times . I think it is important and necessary to think about it , because our children will live in the future .
They ate with the owner of the little house , whose name was John . It was very quiet because they were in nature ; they could just hear cows and John 's two dogs .
I knew , I would not come this world again , everyone has only one change to do whatever they want
your friend for ever .
We can hear many items people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping . Is a kind of relief for them .
I 'm very sorry I have n't written you for such a long time but I had to make a travel to my parents house because my mother was operated on ; do n't worry she is all right now .
Firstly we have a nice and interesting museum , it is located near the hotel .
Pat Kept this a secret for two months but one day told it by accident to a boy from her class . In a few days all school was familiar with Kim 's story . Kim was terrified because everyone was making fun on her and very angry with Pat .

Yours Sincerely
I 'm writing to complain about what it happened me two days ago , during you musical show `` OVER THE RAINBOW '' . A friend of mine went to see it the last May . He told me to go because the actor 's performance was good .
It takes place in Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14 March . It will be great opportunity because it is free for students and we will be able to see the latest fashions in leisure and sports wear , new hairstyles and make up industry .
To finish , I wonder if I need to bring some money or if all has been already payed and what kind of clothes should I bring ?
We are living in the 21st century where everybody is surrounded by advanced technological methods . As a result of all these advanced technological methods , I became one of the daily users of modern technology . Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages .
Dear Mrs. Smith
These are the my suggestions . I hope you will listen my suggestions . This will make the festival better . I hope we will meet next year in the festival .
Could you tell me something about clothes and money which is I need to take with me .
That was my situation at the moment .
Yours sincerely
In addition to this I would like to ask you which kind of clothes and how much money it is necessary to have , since I am undecided about it not knowing the cost of life in California .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Dear Sir
We suggest you to change the programme . We think that Monday and Wednesday are good , but we ask you to change the programme on Tuesday . If it is possible , we want to go to the `` London Fashion and Leisure Show '' and do n't go shopping .
First of all , I thought more than half population of British has `` mobile phone '' , it is small and compact , much lighter than home telephone , and one of the biggest advantage is you can carry it , so that easy to contact your friend or someone who other , even they can easy to contact you as well , so you can phone anytime you wants , whenever you wants .
Thus , you can n't believe what was my disappointment when I noted that it was closed , without no explanation .
I have a friend , his name Peter , he is my best friend .
The activities I would like to do during my stay are golf and surfing .
Finally , I have one question about the money . Which things I must paid for on my travel ?
Spending a week in London for holidays last week , I had decided to go to the theatre in order to see your wonderful musical show . Unfortunately , I had a really disappointed evening ! Indeed , firstly , the play did n't start at 19:30 as it was planned on the advertisement but 45 minutes later ( 20:15 ) .
I would like to answer your questions about this trip . Before everything , I 'm living in Leeds and also studying English in a college . Such being the case , I need to wait until my college 's lessons finishes . If it 's possible for you I would prefer to come in July . Before this time , I usually stay in log cabins , But I never had chance for staying in a tent . According to me , to say in the tents is mor exciting than to stay in the log cabins . That 's why , I would love to choose tents for living for 2 weeks !
Definetely , it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances I really believe you should give me my money back .
I would like to know if is possible for me going on July , because I have school on the others months , and it is impossible for me going on December or January .
I would like to know something about money and clothes . Are they inclued in the prize ? How much money I can spent during this time ? I 'd prefere if you give me this information as soon as you can .
Here is my report for American students who want information on an interesting building to visit in Ankara . I would like to describe 'Anitkabir '
However it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable for example before Christmas or during some special salles . In these periods of the year , the supermarkets and the shops are full of stressed adults and tired children trying to walk in a warm and noisy place .
LONDON
Firstly , the hotel which ha been booked for you is Palace Hotel that is located close to the conference . In order to get from the hotel to the conference , you just need to take the bus we will offer . Secondly , the end-of-conference party will take place in the same hall as the conference at 6 p.m. , which includes dinner and an announcement by the president of the conference . The party is arranged as a casual party , therefore , you can wear comfortable clothes . You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well . Finally , if you want to have an exciting experience in here , I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals . As you may hear , our city is well known for the musicals . Or , If you want to relax , you can take a walk in the park situated in ten minutes distance on foot from the hotel . Whatever you choose , you will be satisfied with your choice .
That is why I think that modern techology helps me in my daily life .
I received your letter which says I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A . I apreicate it and I thank you a lot that you have chosen me as a winner . I acxepted it and I want to inform you that I can travel only on July because I have booked my anual leave that period . Also , I prefer to stay in tents because I have memories from my childhood . Every years my parents used to sent me for holidays at Camps on the mountains so I would like to stay for a while in the same accommodation , and environment . Also , I prefer swimming and painting . I started to learn how to swim when I was 7 years old . My parents brought me to the sea side every weekend so I was used to be inside the water all the seasons . I have taken part in races twice in my life , where I was successful . Also , I like painting from young age , and I have taken part in a public exhibition , where I won the first prize . I would like to ask how much money I should have with me , where can I keep them ? What about the clothes , you do n't mention anything . Do I need something special or ordinary clothes ?
I am writing to complain about the musical show which was presented by The Circle Theatre last week . I saw the performance and it was not like it was mentioned in the advertisent I read in the local newspaper .
Thank you .
Thank you very very much and please keep in contact by e-mail , as normal mail .
should be more . Secondly , the concerts took place in concert halls , which in my opinion were too small . That was the reason why some people were complaining .
On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine . We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical `` Over the Rainbow '' in the `` Circle Theater '' . We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets , but when we arrived , a long line of people were standing there , waiting to get tickets . After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets , we had to wait 45 minutes until it started . One of the points because , I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook , but he did n't play ! So when the miserable musical came to his end , we were happy to leave the theater room , but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant , because no restaurantes were opened anymore , because it started too late . So we went upstairs to find the restaurant , but we just a big empty hall , with nothing in it , with a short sign on a door : `` Sorry , we are closed because of renovations '' ! We thought it would be a joke , but it was n't . Because you are the manager , I think you are the only person who can change something . I would prefer getting my money back , instead of taking a lawyer . I will never visit your theatre again !
Yours sincerely ,
I am writing you to give you the information you need , but first of all I would say that I am really delighted and I would thank you .
Dear Ms Jane Clark ,
I went to your annual international arts festival . I really enjoyed it , although I feel it could have been better . But firstly I want to congratulate you for organizing such a huge festival , people need this kind of events . Secondly I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it . As it was written in your advertisement , artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented , I was quite disappointed . However the concerts were great , but unfortunately , some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as a micro-wave inside .
Is that enjoyable ?
Dear Kim ,
Yours , sincerely
I would be very grateful , if you gave me a possibility of singing . I 've always wanted to learn singing professionaly , but I 've never had an occasion . I 'm very keen on swimming , too . Normally , I live in the seaside and I could n't live without this sport . Last year I was even champion of my school in crawl for one hundred meters . distance .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
lausanne , the 17th of June 2000
8 Jun 2000
Yours sincerely
The name of the building is 'Sunshine 60 ' . This is the highest building in Tokyo . I recommend to visit . I have three reasons for my recommendation .
So I want my money back for these two tickets - I have included a copy - and I hope you will pay more attention to the way you treat your customers , and avoid false advertisement .
Your sincerely
Then we expected to , see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . We did see Tina Truelove but we did not see Danny Brook . That was very disapponted .
I look forward to your reply .
They have n't respect the timetable , the show had to begun at 19:30 and he started at 20:15 how can you explain this fault ? !
I write to complain about the show `` Over the Rainbow '' I saw last night . Firstly I was very disappointed in finding out that not-ever-heard actors were playing instead of the ones we all expected .
Finally , I would like to ask you to give some money back to me .
The place I would like to recommend is the seventienth-century Royal Palace . It is situated in a heart of Warsaw and surrounded by the buildings of an Old Town . There is a square old Market with the magnificent statue of the King Zygmunt , in the centre of it .
I 'm writing this letter to express the reasons of our disappointment about that evening .
At first I felt really annoyed and disappointed so I run to my brother in order to explain him what I had seen .
Long time ago , there were two brothers , whose parents were dead . Their parents were rich , so when they passed away they left a lot of money .
I enjoyed a lot participating in your competition and hope to apreciate the travel I won .
Now a days fashion play big roll in our daily life . Million kinds of fashion magazines and News paper tells you how much people are interested in fashion .
Suddenly , the door was opened .
Yours sincerely ,
The Home of the Future
Dear Sir ,
Secondly , I would like to ask you for some information . Would you be kind enough to tell me which kind of clothes I should bring with me ? Could you possibly tell me how much money I might spend at California Camp ? Would you recommend me to bring some equipment , like a rope , sticks , with me ?
Who would like to be famous ?
First of all , I would like to thank you for your activity programme . I find it really good , specially because of the visit to the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery .
I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement of The Circle theater said about the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow ' and the things I noticed when I was there .
In conclusion , the addvertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out , but it was not , so I would like to ask for my money back .
I hope to see you soon .
Dear Kim ,
Dear Sir ,
I look forward to hearing from you
Well I think that is all , but I will ask you to give my money back .
You also asked me about two activities . I choose singing because I love singing and I am in a choir for 7 years now . I also choose climbing . Unfortunately I am not so good in it . But I would take the opportunity to improve myself .
In conclusion , even though we know that this character is good and this one is bad , sometimes the good ones are quite boring , and we find the bad one much more interesting .
I have TV 's and radios so I can watch or listen to various newses and I do n't have to go to football pitches to see how the players are playing .
I am writing to you to explain how was my experience in the theatre last Friday . I did not expect to find all the problems that I had .
Firstly , you spoke about two actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , instead of them we had two others and they were really bad . So I was really surprised . In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late . It was boring for everybody . How could we appreciate the show properly .
Moreover , the work I 've had to do , apart from carrying material , was essentially to sell tickets for the concert , which has allowed me to meet a lot of nice people and to become friend with some of them . Even though my entire body aches ( material was quite heavy ) and I am tired , I would n't call it a work ! I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Modern technology has completly changed my daily life , which became more comfortable , and easier .
I think that the most disappointing think was that theatre 's restaurant was closed . I would to add that I was hungry after the show .
Before catching our plane , we will be able to enjoy going shopping around the airport for three hours in the afternoon . Because there are so many unique shops and you should buy good gifts for your parents
Another thing different from your schools is that we do n't change classrooms between periods . We stay in the class in which we have been registered for the whole year , and a different teacher comes in every period .
Your sincerely ,
On the other hand , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show and we would all like to go the show . We think it is a good opportunity because london fashion is the most important over the world , and we all learn a lot about London style going to this show .
I am writing to you about your theatre : 'over the rainbow ' . I went to a performance and I am very disappointed . Firstly , your advertisement said the actor would be Danny Brook , but it was not . It played an other one who played very bad . Secondly , the musical should start on 19.30 , but we had to wait until 20.15 ! It was boring that nothing happend such a long time on the stage . Did you know that you have no discounts on your tickets ? I could not believe that . Why do you write things on your advertisement when nothing is true ? And finally , I would had my dinner after this disappointment musical and thougt I go to 'Theatre restaurant ' . But how can it be , it was closed !
There was a lot of work to do but we were happy to do it with glad people and at the end we had the possibility to take part in the pop concert . It was wonderful !
Therefore my girlfriend lived alone so I could have stayed with her or just have gone on travelling around the world . I was thinking a lot about this problem and how to solve it so I needed someone to talk to and Pat had always been my best friend .
In fact , shopping is not always enjoyable because sometimes you want to buy articles but you do n't have enough money !
After the show had finished I went to the theatre restaurand to hav something to drink and get relaxed but it was closed because the stuff was on holiday .
And finally , after the show , I wanted to drink a coffee but the theatre restaurant was closed !
Dear Alice ,
Dear Sir/Madam
In my opinion , there are two possible fashions for the future . If humans turn to be more free from social rules , I think that their dressing will also be very extreme and unlimited . There will be a variety of colours and fashion styles . Everybody will wear anything he/she likes , choosing clothes from any century they wishe without this being strange . On the other hand , if human society turns to be stricher and more limited , there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing , formed by the needs of the society . All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule around . Perhaps the style of their dressing will indicate their position in society too .
Shopping may be enjoyable or not at all !
I look forward to hearing from you .
Second , Modern technology makes communication much easier and more enjoyable . With the spreading use of Internet , people living in different parts of the world can chat with each other through the web . And , we can also share important informations with other people . The development of information technology has changed the world into `` an earth village '' .
In my last letter I promised to write you about my experience working at pop-concert . The job came unexpectedly as my friend , who was supposed to work there , broke her leg just two days before the event . So she asked me to fill her position . Even I had planned something else to do I agreed because she 's my very good friend .
I write you this letter because I want to tell you my experiences of the festival . I have spent two days at the `` International Arts Festival '' and I have to say that it was a good event but I think some details could be better the next time . For example , on the leaflet it was written that there will be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries . That was disappointing ! Some concert halls were really small so that there was bad air and not enough place for everyone and you could not enjoy anything ! What about plays and films ? It was a small offer ; I hope it will be larger the next time .
thank you .
My second task was that I had to look in all the bags of the fans to collect `` dangerous '' items , I saw really funny things like teeth-bruches in the bags . This part of my work was really funny and I enjoyed it .
I was very nervous because I 'd never been in a concert before and an hour before everything stated the singer and the musicians were there and I could n't avoid it and I started crying - you can imagine , they were so handsome that I could n't belive it - I tried to calm down because I had to work , and later I began feeling more comfortable and when the concert started everything was such exciting that the time ran very fast - although I was working - and it was like a dream .
On the last day , the students can enjoy a sightseeing tour around the city , which can be arranged if the students want to . The group can also visit the zoo , the opera or stay and relax at the college 's enormous garden and enjoy the settings .
I am writing to inform you about the bad experience I had last evening going to the theatre .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ? In what way will they change ? Of course nobody knows the answer and maybe we should be happy for that .
I am writing this letter to make you know the bad points of the theatre .
People all have different opinions about books . Some prefer realistic stories whereas others do unusual ones . But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway 's `` The Old Man and the Sea ' .
When Charles told Carlotta what he knew , Carlotta started crying .
I know , they are not like us . They are famous , but I think they need to be alone sometimes . They nead to be with their family in silence . This is important for everybody and I think this is important for them , too .
A very good point of this change is that women have more freedom to have a job because before reaching the technology they have to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave oven .
The path we were walking in was quite clean and I was feeling really happy and relaxed ... until we reached a river . There were nor bridge nor a canoe , the only way to cross it was walking on an old big trunk which was lying down , peacefully , making the only connection between our side and the other .
Thank you .
In spide that fact there are of course many families especialy in small towns which eat lunch all together and they they solve their problem all together . Parents play with children and have fun . And the difference in that children is effectivily when they grown up and want to make a family they do the same with their parents and make a happy family .
The other day , I worked at a pop concert to help . It was really interesting than I expected . My job at behind the stage was helping make-up , hare and clothes staylist . It was very hard . The singers often changed them clothes and them make-up was easy to be off because of the sweat . It was different from I did at college . There was no time to rest . But I met a lot of famous singer and spoke to them . In front of the stage was so many people and they could n't see them very well , but I was at very near from the stage and I could see them just there .
So , we can be connected other people with a mobile phone no matter where you are and you can correspond to other contry people in real time by using internet . How incredable it is !
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Ms ,
It does not matter to me whether I stay in tent or log cabin , but I would prefer tent to be much more in contact with wild life and nature .
OLYMPIQUE MUSEUM
First of all , about your enquires , the only time suitable for me to travel is in July . The reason is that my academic year starts in August therefor I need to be here .
I think the people who are enjoying shopping they are greede for materialistic things and they hav n't interests for spirit ( ? ) , intelect life . They are loosing time of their life for nothing . In my opinion we must spend more time for more interesting than shopping things like sport , reading , chating about ideas which make our lives better . We must do something for help other people to feel better and usefull .
First of all , it would be suitable for me to travel in July only , because that is when I am on holiday from work .
As a conclusion , it was the worse evening I have ever had in my life so I ask you for money back .
Dear Sir Brown , I 'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw . I had n't a good time ! Firstly , Danny Brook did n't act . There was an other actor , James Kee , but I did n't like him ! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he was n't there . In addition to , the show did n't start at 20.15 ; so it ended at 23.45 and I could n't go to a meeting . I 'm very disappointed for all these problems ! Your theatre is very disorganized ! The ticket 's price was £20 and there was n't any discount ! After the show , I wanted to eat something , but the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was in Italy for a special course . I had n't a great fun , so I ask for money back . Your faithfully
First of all , I would like to travel only in July due to my work commitment . I am allowed to take holiday only in July .
I wish this is enough to express my feeling and I hope someday we can share such things together .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it
Then , surfing in internet is becoming my passion : it 's incredible how many unthinkable activities you can do with it . It 's simply fantastic !
I prefer to live in log cabin because I think it 's more comfortable . There are warmer and drier and I 'm afraid of insects and spiders .
By my side the vocal of the Almendegos was and he touched my arm . I will never wash my arm again . After all of this we saw the show in the best place , near of the stage and after , the thing that I most liked , we were convidated to see the group and had their signatures .
What I particularly liked about this experience was meeting my favourite pop group and talk with them about their lifes as a pop group . I also enjoyed being able to work as a team with both all the members of the club and the BSB . It was one of the best experiences I have had in all my life
Thank you for your letter and congratulations ! I have always been interested in visiting other contries . In fact it did n't want to ask my parents for money , and going on holiday with you would be an ideal solution .
Hi ! How are you doing ? I had a wonderful time last month . I helped a pop concert as a charity . My jobs were collecting a ticket , saling goods and refreshment , guiding people to a right seat and cleaning up the concert hole after finish a concert . I was n't allowed to help a heavy work , even though I wanted to do , because I 'm woman . What I particularly liked about the experience was the concert had achived by our supports . It seemed that all people , audience , the band and stuffs were delightful . If I have chance , I want to help a concert again . I have never felt such as satisfaction . I really recomend you to help them , I think this is a good oppotunity and I want you understand my feeling well . I 've got lots of things about the concert to talk to you . I want to know your openion .
Pat told me that he was also in love with me . He told me that it was nessary to do something about . But I did n't know what to do .
People who have their car , they do n't attempt to walk on foot even if it is short distance .
Dear Sir :
First of all , I would like to travel only in July because I am employed and will be able to finish my contract in June . On August I am going to apply for a new job .
Yours faithfully ,
Your sincerely
Excuse me that I did n't write you sooner . As you know , I was fairly busy with my studying for my First Certificate .
You wrote to me that I have a chance to do two activities , which I can choice . I 'm quite good in paiting and I play tennis . I 'll be very happy when you can give me a chance to use the camp 's art studio and you 'll be able to prepare some paiting 's materials like oil paints canvas and bruches for me . The size of the canvas is n't so important .
I asked for the discounts available as we were a group of 15 people , but the answer I was given was that nobody had ever heard of them .
Po Lin Temple is opened to public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Monday to Friday , and 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday .
Thank you very much for the prize . I am writing this letter to inform you that I have recieved your letters and I am going to the trip .
One night , I heard a strange sound . I loocked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine . They went into the house through a window . I though it was some rubbers .
IT 'S UNDENYABLE THAT DURING THIS CENTURY OUR WORLD HAS BEEN CHANGING . NEWS INVENTS HAVE BEEN INVENTED AND THE SCIENCE HAS BEEN IN QUICK PROGRESS . AS A RESULT OF THIS PEOPLE 'S DAILY LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGING AS WELL .
Love
I realised that my bag was outside and I went out to look for it , when a rain of stones covered the entrace of the hole . I was terrified , I knew that the only solution was to ask for helping . I walked alone a long distence until I found a telephone , I called the police and they ask for a rescue .
I look forward to hearing from you very soon .
Second , it started only at 20:15 . It was 45 minutes later than it suppose to be . It was a such boaring to wait the show in a noisy and hot theatre .
Hope to hear from you :
You need more explanations about me to understand my motivations at the end of this story . In fact , I did this kind of studies because of my interests in programming . The problem is that I ca n't keep calm during an exam to succeed .
I 'm a shopaholic , but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable . For instance , I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy , we went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends ' graduation ( besides other reasons ) . They had invited us and we wanted them to see us stunningly beautiful .
Secondly , I would rather stay in a tent , because when I was a child I used to go to a campsite and stay in a tent with my family for two weeks every summer and I thoroughly enjoyed it .
Life is really easy . You need to learn how you can use the technology . But , sometimes I miss past days . I miss to play in the garden , post a mail to my friends , forget the important day . Sometimes I want to go to somewhere without technology .
Dear Kim
Best wishes .

One year later , I was working in Kang-nam police station in Seoul . Suddenly , the theft signal came into . So , another policeman and I had to arrive at the accident place quickly . When we arrived at the place which it happened , one man started running away . Without any thought , I ran quickly like a swallow . Then , he tried to go over the wall , I held his leg . He fell down and we had to stare at each other . After we fought for a minute , I was able to arrest him . As a result , I could go on vacation . When I said to my mother , she asked me not to do it again .
My name is Bao-yu Liao . I am representative of our class in your college to write to you .
I want to know what kind of clothes I have to wear there and how much money I will spend . I want to know if I can take my celular phone , too .
I think this topic is so exciting in the antropological and psicological point of view , because we can studie the reaction before , during and after to shopping .
Every artist could scream at me whenever they wanted . The realy thing was that I had to look after them because without me they would have been lost . That was a good feeling for me . I had to tell them when they had to go on stages . What kind of clothes they shoot wear . I also had to give them drinks and food and help them to relax whenever they were nervous .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Helen :
Last week I went to the Circle theatre , of which you are responsable , to se the musical show `` Over the Rainbow '' . The advertisement outside the theatre explained a lot of interesting things to enjoy . I am writing this letter because I have had a very disappointing evening . Everything in the advertisement has been done in the Wrong Way . Firstly there was a different actor in the starring ; you have written DANNY BROOK and he was absent . I had joined the show because I like DANNY BROOK a lot , but you have changed the program . Moreover the advertisement said that the show time was 19.30 ; on the contrary it started with 45 minutes of late . Another thing that was wrong is about discounts : you had written they were available , but they were not and so I had to pay the whole ticket 's price . But the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant of the theatre was closed and so I had to go to another place to have dinner .
I 'm a student . My school starsts in September and it finishes in June . July is months when I 'm having a rest and I 'm doing nothing . In August I 'm working in the shop which is my sister . If I could go in July would be greate .
Pusan Castle
Re activities : During the two weeks I would like to do tennis and swimming . I regularly play tennis since I was nine years old and I entered several competitions . Swimming is another sport I learned when I was six .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I join this letter my two tickets .
Besides all those improvements and confort I ca n't stop thinking where all this will lead us . I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives however I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or had already fallen in wicked hands .
Well , that 's all . I hope one day you get to change what you wanted . I miss you and let 's keep in touch . Bye..
After all things that I have mentioned it is clearly seen that shopping is not enjoyable .
First of all , I am sorry to say that I could only travel in July . As my family 's new restaurant is about to open in August , I need to help with the restaurant , which is expected to be rather busy .
First of all , these starrings of the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . The only one reason I bought your ticket was because of Danny Brook and Tina Trulove , as your advertisement had shown . But your starrings were not .
As a result , we came back home in order to eat some fast food .
ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME , ACCOMMODATION 'S PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO . ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION - I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL IN JULY . THE REASON IS I AM WORKING FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY AS A MARKETING SPECIALIST AND WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST TELECOMMUNICATION FAIR IN THE WORLD WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN SEPTEMBER . WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS WHOLE AUGUST SO THE ONLY ONE VACATION MONTH I CAN GO IS JULY .
I just want to ask you for something else . How many jeans , Pants , sweater etc ... do I have to take ? and how much money would I need to bring in my pocket ?
As the show is held on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00 we could go there instead of doing shopping in the afternoon . By this way , we would visit the museum as you had planned and n Wednesday afternoon we could use the free time to do some shopping if we wished it .
Thank you for your lovely letter and I hope you are well .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Fashion in 100 years
Dear Helen Ryan ,
In my opinion it should be a rule which let the medias approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home to leave them at least one place to feel safe .
Not only these subjects are studied by us , but also Latin , Russian , Ukrainian , Biology and Phisical training , but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects .
By the time I get home , I would be completely exhausted . As you can see , shopping is not always enjoyable .
But this time things have gone too far .
On the other hand I would like to request all details of accommodation and if you could specifie what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money I have to take .
As for the accommodation I would prefer log cabins . I 'm not a kind of person who can easily fall a sleep and it gets worse when I am in a tent .
`` Are you looking for these ? '' asked Philip showing the keys of the car .
On the other hand , the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us . When there was a restful we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late . We could n't have a drink . Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give my money back because on the advertisement there was some things that we had n't in the theatre .
Othrewise , there are people who think the opposite ; such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they go to buy hardly ever , only when they need clothes or something for their job or school . In that way shopping can be as funny as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation in the future .
What could be out of control of technology ? Since the scientific revolution and the Industrial Revolution , between 17th and 18th century there have been sudden changes in our daily way of living .
12th June 2001
Please , do not hesitate to contact me at the above address if you need any further information .
There is one more thing . When you are a man and your wife asks you to come for shopping , be patient ! Because women loves shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always giving your opinion about clothes , music , parfums ...
Also , I prefer to stay in tents because I think it is a good chance for me to live with the nature and to wake up listening birds which singing . It will be nice !
Dear Ms. Ryan
Finally , I need to know what kind of clothes and how many I should pack . Is there any place that I can wash my clothes ? I also needed some information on the money I will take . Do you have any kind of souvenirs that I can buy ? Do I need to take any money at all ?
Last month I had the most exciting experience in my life , as you know I was helping at the pop concert and it was amazing !
As a result we were grouded for all holidays and all because our almost perfect Pat .
Dear Mr. maneger of The Circle Theatre :
This is going to take place on tuesday march 14 at 10.00 to 19.00 .
All of us know the technology and science has affected our lives . Seen my hole life I can say the moden technology has changed my daily life in many ways .
I have recieved your letter this morning . I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill and is unable to attempt the conference ; I am glad that you are able to be the leader of the group . I hope that these informations below are very useful to you , during your attempt of conference .
I used to like shopping , but recently I came across many disadvantage of this activity . Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything what they want . It is n't true . Nowdays we have many big shopping centers . We like them because everything is on one place . The most suitable time for shopping is weekand when parents do n't work and children have n't got a school . Because of that shopping centers are over crowded . You ca n't buy something in peacful and calm athmospher . In addition in such kind of shops prizes are very high , of course not all of them . However such centers are very useful and necessary . I my opinion the worst thing which may happened is extremly hugh queu to the changing room . It is really exhausting . Afterwards you are all in . Nevertheless sometimes shopping could be enjoyable . If you bought something goregous , you would be very happy . On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you have bad mood do n't go shopping .
However I would like to know if by any chance the photograpy activities are only for beginners . In this case I would rather do some climbing , which I have never done before .
Hi Kim !
The two activities that I prefer will be Basketball , because I had the experience to play in my school 's big for almoust a year , and Photography , which is a hobby that I am good at and I practice since I was ten .
13th June 2000
Dear Manager : I am Angela Ounis and I am writting to you because I went to see 'Over the Rainbow ' , London 's newest and best musical show . I am very disappointing at this evening 's show . First of all the starring that was supposed to be ( Danny Brook and Tina Truelove ) were n't there , I was so enthusiastic about your starring , when I realized was a failure , even though they do good , it was n't the same . I arrived there , at 19:15 , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 , but started at 20:15 , it can not be possible that a schedule for a show have had a big change . You go there to see a show and have a good time , not to wait forever until you want . Also was said that Discounts will be available , but I did n't received any discount as you were cheating us . I know that you have a big responsability but if you told something to people , do it . On the other hand , the theatre Restaurant was closed because they 've got a problem with the schedule 's organization . That was so uncomfortable , people was starving . I am so disappointed with this , that I am in all my right to ask for some money back , your theatre show was n't expected . Please let me know . sincerely yours
The End .
It would be come true in the near future . Our robot maid will do all of house work instead of human . In addition to this you will be able to control all part of house by a computer such as temperature or vacume cleaning .
Lots of Love
However , journalists should not only think about commercial value , but morality and priciples are also being concerned . Of course , it everyone pays less attention or interest , the situations should be better . I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana died in the car crash was one of the most disarster examples .
. There is an easy reach to cashpoints , lavatories , emergency services , etc .
Now I will give you the informations which you asked for . For me it is only possible to travel in July . That is the only month where I have time because after July I have to start with the University .
Finally , I would like to ask you which kind of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp , the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves .
In the last fifty years the human tecnologies are growed up exponensially . First the conquist of the space , then the computers , and now the new biotecnologies have changed , and are changing , the face of the word .
Thank you very much and I look forward to hear from you .
Dear Kim
Thank you for an unusual event
Dear Kim !
To sum up , famous people are the same as we are , and we all have the right to lead a private life and no right to break into their privacy . Therefore , I strongly believe that famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Secondly the play did n't start at 19:30 as we were being told but it started with a delay of 45 minutes . Also when I visited the theatre 's restaurant I found it closed because of renovation .
Finally , on the last day you have three hours before you catch the plane so we suggestion , you can go to shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to museam because this museam is the biggest in the world now It is up to you .
Last week my son and I went to see Over the rainbow at the Circle theatre . We paid to see Danny Brook , my son 's favorite actor , but we seems quite disappointing , my son was very happy because he would see for the first time his favorite actor . However it 's just the begining of the problems we had . Expecting the britan pontuality we went to the theatre at 19:00 to wath the 19:30 section but it only starts at 20:15 , it finished later than it was suposed to and then we missed the train . I have n't seen any discounts available , I though my son would payed less than I . As we had alredy missed the first we went at the theatre restaurant that is famous for the good food , however it was closed .
Clothes in the future
yours sincerely
Yesterday I decided to go to the `` blue disco '' because the guy I liked was going to be there . But there was a little problem and it was that my parent 's did n't let me go alone to disco 's , so I had to go illegaly , and I decided I would do it .
Yours sincerely ,
Bye and think on this .
Your faithfully
As you already know we are going to have the end-of-conference party where the Head of the college will give a small speech at the begining , then it will a buffet and a disco . You do n't need to dress up smartly but please , make sure that your students do n't wear short or trainers .
Dear Matt :

On the other hand , this kind of facility has made our life more comfortable and easy . In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carring lugguage and shopping bags . Cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journey . For example , in the past it would had been extremely exhausting travelling riding a hourse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of optionals to choose with .
We have to teach to our children the value of the money , to explain the difficulties to earn money in a job , because we have to work eight , nine or ten hours a day , for example . It 's a first step to educate the youngest and to help our society .
I am writing to give you futher information about me which you need about Camp California .
Dear readers
Thank you very much for your letter , I 'm very happy to receive some news about you . I 'm going to reply at your question .
If we came back to the past , we felt everything , it was so difficult to do , we would have plane and done by ourself and last time .
I started to get along with other people and had new friends but I continued telling Pat my secrets . My new friends sometimes talked to me about Pat and they asked me once if we were close friends . I asked them why they had asked me that . Their answer surprised me too much . They told me Pat used to be a close friend of them and she used to talk about me and my problems . So , they had already knew all my secrets for a long time !
GUSTAV SOARES .
We look forward to hearing from you relating to this matter .
But , Mark , Pat and I were planning a birthday-party for Sally on June 2 at her own home . It should have been `` surprising '' . Sally 's husband is now in Singapore on business , so she had to spend her birthday without him . Considering her loneliness , we made every effort to please her and to encourage her ; because she was loved by everybody for her gentle , kind and lovely character . She was not so lucky in her life . Her parents already died when she was in the high-school . She has no brothers and sisters . After marriage , Sally and her husband Nigel realized that they would not be able to have their children . In spite of such difficulties , she always shows a pretty charming smile to us .
Mrs Smith ,
Yours Faithfully ,
SO , I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD REFUND OF ALL OR PART OF MY MONEY WHICH I PAID FOR THE SHOW .
This story started when I arrived to this town with family . We come here to build our own house because my father had been fired and we had to sell our house in Buenos Aires . My mother suggested to come here because one of her brothers was established here and he could help us .
When I stay home I can watch or listen to the radio e.t.c . so the modern technology help me to spend my free time .
It would be interesting to film a math lesson . As it is very boring , everybody would understand how difficult it is to get good marks at the final examination .
So , I 'm free when I 'm out of the school . I 'd like it would be nicer going there .
The second day objective was to install the scene , with lights , loudspeakers and all stuff . This job was quite hard , but we took enough time to be not exhausted !
2 . - I have chosen singing and painting as activities , because I love painting moreover , I am very good at it , and singing because is one of my talents .
So , Why do n't we think more about the future , instead of being upset of how to get some money to spend next party ?
Tadeusz Ochman
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets so he told his mother how his brother Jim lost her suit suitcase on the train . Jim 's mum did n't want him to take her suitcase , but he did it . So a morning he reached Victoria Station with the suitcase and take the train for the countryside where he had to work . But when he walked out the station he realised that he have lost the suitcase on the train . Then he waited for the next train to London and he caught it . He was worried about his mother 's reaction , but when he arrived he went to the Station Manager 's office and he found it on the table . He was so happy ! All this story was a secret but Pat realived to his mother . She was so angry and confused because Jim have n't told her the truth .
Shopping is annoying but also necessary , it is why it is not always enjoyable .
Dear , Helen
Conclusion : I do think , however , the modern technology is essential for human being nowadays . Although the world of computers will develop day by day , I lively hope we ( human being ) could mantain our personality of seeing things .
write me soon .
According to your letter , I should tell you when I would like to travel and I think July is the best time for me because I will be on summer vacations so I would not have to miss any classes .
I think I could leave for the camp in July . Because I 'm supposed to attend an English course in Weymouth , England until June and then I 'm going to travel in Europe with my sister who came from my country 4 weeks ago for this trip . We are planning to spend 2 weeks travelling . So I can go to the camp in the middle of the July .
I would like to congratulate you for the excellent programme that you have prepared . I think that is such a good programme especially because the places that we visit , like the Science Museum , are very interesting .
Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen , it will still be filled with vegetables and meat . This is because people wo n't miss the great taste of food although it could be subsituted to a vitamin pill or two .
to finish off , I would like to ask you how much money is needed for my personal shopping and what kind of clothes I should take .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . She was my best friend for several years as a child . But I have n't seen her since we were 10 years old . When were nine years old and were in thired grade we had a 'House ' where we used to play all afternones . In fact it was n't a realy house , it was some stones between the trees in the littel forest neear our house . But we used to call it 'Our House ' . It was a secret place and we had promissed each other not to tell anybody about it . Useally we were cooking flower-soup , and talking secrets .
In fact , your musical show was attractive : actors , time , restaurant , discount tickets , and also the title ! I started to be OK with the `` Your perfect evening out '' , sure not to be deceived .
Secondly I would prefer sleeping in log cabins because I fell much more comfortable . One reason is the cold , and the other is that I can not sleep on the floor because I have problems in my back .
Hello . I 'm Robert and I 'm writting for the article about clothes in the future . In my oppinion , in a hundred of years , we 'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays . What will change in clothes , will be the comfortability of them and the way they protect us and our body from temperature and physical agressions . I think they will cold us in the summer and makes us hot in the winter . Clothes will be more personalized and they 'll make us feel better and more free . Wearing them we 'll be able to dive underwater with a high pressure , and we 'll have freedom of movement . Technology will take part in clothes development , scientists will search the way to reduce the weight of clothes and they will become very light and comfortable , so I want to be in the future to enjoy the clothes . I wish I win the trip !
I am writing about International Arts Festival which I went to recently . I had a great time there because taking a place the kind of festival in my town is very unusual . I think that International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful . I was also pleased with the weekend ticket because I tend to go out in the weekend due to my work in the weekday so that I had time to go and did not have to care about the ticket price .
report on the group leader
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . Two days ago I thought I could trust Pat because she was not going to tell anybody our secret , our important secret . I wish I had never told her anything .
I have to tell you that this experience was wonderful and in fact I enjoyed a lot and of course I knew a lot of people there .
The two activities which I find better for me are swimming and sailing . I love the sea , that is why I became interested in those activities since I was ten , therefore I have a lot of experience in both .
Dear Ms Helen Ryan
Dear Kim
My dissatisfaction became even bigger when I had realize that there had been a different actor than Danny Brook performing !
I do n't know exactly how I felt , sometimes I wake up and think it was nothing but a dream . I hope you liked everything I said and I hope an answer as soon as possible .
By the following , I would like to inform you that I 've assisted your new musical show , which name is `` Over the rainbow '' , last Saturday evening , 10th June . I 'm writing you to make a complaint on your advertisement , which I consider like a lying advertisement . Let me explain you why I 'm now so disappointed . I 've spent one week holiday in London with my husband for our honeymoon . We had preparred quiet a long time ago , this travel to the capital and spared a lot of money as well .
Yours sincerely ,
Well , but I do n't regret going to that concert . It was wonderful ! You know I love designing clothes , and there I had the chance to make a dream come true .
At first , you advertisement said there were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but it had different actor disappointely . Secondly , it said the show started at 19:30 , but it deleyed to 20:15 . I had to wait 45 minutes , wasting time .
To make matters worse , your theatre restaurant was closed and one of your assistants said that it was being under construction for the expansion of that place .
I am generally known as an easy-going person and I can remain calm in the emergency situations and I am quite reliable too .
M. Brown has booked rooms in the Palace Hotel . This is a first class hotel . The easiest way from the hotel to the conference is with the bus . There is a bus stop in front of your hotel . Take the bus in direction center town . After four stops get off the bus . The name of this bus stop is 'Kongresshaus ' . If you leave the bus , the conference is in the house opposite the road . You ca n't miss it .
Mobile phones are another thing that is making my life much easier . They allow you to talk to other people no matter where you are . This can be very useful when you have a problem that needs an immediate solution .
Competition Organiser
I write this letter because I find there were too many problems concerning your musical show : `` Over the rainbow '' .
Yours sincerely
Believe it or not , our lives are changing and becoming more complicated every day . The reason of all of this things is the impressionable introduction of the `` new technologies '' , such as Computers , Internet or WAP technologies .
To put it in a nutshell , I would like to say that technology can be a good thing , but it creates many problems too .
According to your advertisement , it stars DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE , but surprisinggly , it was proformed by a different actor who I even did n't know the name . In addition , the show was supposed to be started at 19:30 but it was half hour later , until 20:15 .
When I 'd time I will write you again
Also I would like to ask you some questions . Do I have to bring a lots of money ? I mean do I have to pay for the tent ? What about the clothes do I have to bring a lot ? That is all i want to know . Thank you
I like shopping . Some people when they are tired relax spleeping , reading a book or watching television but not me . Walking along the crowded streets of my city is my way of relaxing .
As for selecting two activities , basketball and surfing are definitely on my list . I spend one third of my spare time playing basketball . As a result , I have an important position in our local basketball team . Surfing was a fresh sport to me which I took up recently . It is really fasinating to challenge waves . I wish I could learn more so that I could enjoy it more in the future .
I am so pleased that I have won the first prize in your competition .
Dear Kim ,
Dear manager I am writing you because of your new musical show `` Over The Rainbow '' . I have spent my holiday in London recently and it is like a tradition , we went to a musical . After reading your programme I was very impressed and I was looking forward to see it . But firstly when we bought our tickets , we did n't get any discount , we had to pay the full price . And then the show started at 20:15 p.m. , although it was supposed to start at 19:30 p.m. , so we 've had to wait quite long in this crowded room . And when the show finally started , I realized that it was not Danny Brook acting , instead there was an unknown , not very talented actor . After the show we wanted to go to your theatre restaurant , because we were very hungry , but then we saw that it was closed , because of staff illness . I would like to ask you to give us our money back , because it has been a very disappointing evening for us . Yours sincerely , Sara Schmidt
I had a really nice time with them even tought I would 've prefered to stay at the front with the others people , but anyway it was a great experience for me , I holp to be able to help them next year .
I look forwards to hearing from you
There is a party on the last day of the conference . Special awards will be given to the students whose reports are the best . Less of the party is likely to be as our night club so a lots of music , dancing and fun are provided . Please note that the alchocholich drinks are only sold untill 11pm . You can wear whatever you like for this kind of party .
The end-of-conference party is to be held at the 'Royal Room ' of the hotel , which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness . Therefore , all guests will be asked to wear the corresponding clothes in order to be accepted .
We lived in my aunt 's house who was in the center of the village . In front of my aunt 's house , there is a house with swimming pool , garage and garden . My aunt told me it was the famous French singer 's house .
At first , I applyed for the volenteer at the pop concert and then I got a responsibility for control the audience . I had to make the fan to keep a queue . I also make them find their seats . It was very hard working . For example , I always spoke loudly and run fast .
My life have been changed by technological improving . Nowadays . We have so many technological things . For instance , TV , computers , telephone , air-conditionings . These things are very convinience on the other hand , there lots of disadvantage point .
It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed a necessary condition in some professional activities . Trades , politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs . However , the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes , when in the hands of a high-school student .
I will be very thankfull if your could return me half or some of my money , or even to make the corresponding discount .
I 'm looking forward to receiving your next letter soon .
Secondly , I bought a second musical show ticket which start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 . As a result , I had to wait over one hour as I arrived there at 19:00 .
My tasks were very especifics . I had to help with the layout of the stage , which was very complicated , because there are so many cables , and weir and things going on at the same time . After that part was fully-functioning I moved on to work in the back stage .
Mankind has been always seeking different things . We'are learning a lot of things about life . and we are practicing these . In the future life will be more artifitual than I had been before .
To conclude , will you kindly let my know if I need some money and what sort of clothes I should bring with me .
AUTHORITIES OF THE CIRCLE THEATRE :
Thank you very much for the prize .
I you would like more information do not hesitate to contact me .
I am a member in the council team so I decided to help them at a pop concert that was organized in the last month . I helped them to prepare the room for the bads and I decorated the place for the singers . Also , I assisted them to choose the right instruments and to test them . It took a long time to testifite the speakers and the microphones . Unless this preparation , I also took part to the concert . I helped them to the music and to the songs . It was a quite difficult assiment but I got very good experience . I understood it when the concert had finished . The audients was excited and I can not discribe my happyness . It was some thing that I did n't expect . Also , it happen first time in my life . I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were accompaning our songs . I enjoyed very much and I want to tranfere my enjoyment to you though this letter .
Yours Sincerely ,
Recently I had a week 's holiday in London . During my stay I went to The Circle Theatre to see `` Over the rainbow '' , the `` London 's newest and best musical show . '' I have to admit that was my great mistake . Never before had I such a disappointing evening .
I would like to travel on July because I will be on my school vacation , so I would not miss my classes .
Dear Madam Ryan ,
Two days before the event Carol , Albert , Sam and me went to visit Pat in her house and she invited us to stay for dinner . We were having a wonderful time chatting and laughing but suddenly the phone rang and Pat answer it . It was her aunt inviting her for the weekend so Pat said very loudly : `` I 'm sorry but I have to go to Sam 's flat and decorate it , it 's a surprise , do n't tell anybody ''
Unable to keep a secret he told for everyone , ended his friendship with Ted , now Ted is rejective for everyone , no one talks to him and Pat is the example , but without his best friend and his honestity .
Let 's have a surprise ?
I think I ca n't forgotten this experience on my mind
In the end I would like you to tell me if I should take some special clothes and also the sum of money I will need ... during my vacation .
I am only available in July because I am studying in an engineering school and I 'll work until the end of June . But no problem for July !
SECONDLY , WE CA N'T FORGET EITHER THAT ALL OF US HAVE CONDITIONS TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE BY MOBILE PHONES , BY INTERNET , WHO LIVE NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY , BUT ALSO ABROAD .
Yours Faithfully ,
First of all I would like to thank you for the perfect organisation of the competition which I luckely won , I have been really very impressed .
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and lessons be filmed into a short video . In order to write the report I interviewed about one hundred students who are studying in our English class .
I would like to come in july because I work in a big company where you have to take your holiday in this month .
We are concerned that this is a great and the only opportunity for us to see this show , as it takes place only once a year and only in London . Certainly , we do not refuse to take part in other activities in London . Probably , you will agree just to put London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday .
I hope your questions re answered appropriatly .
Regarding starting time and the theatre restaurant , to see the musical I had to wait about 45 minuits because it started at 20:15 . As well as this , after seeing the musical I went to the theatre restaurant , which you referred in your advertisement , but it was closed already . I was really angry !
To sum up , I would like to add that this house is the most famous in our city . You should come and visit it for the paintings or for the building itself .
Looking forward to receiving your prompt reply .
I also have some enquiries concerning the trip . I would like to know what the weather would be like at that time of the year so I am able to pack the essential clothings . I would appreciate it if you also advise me on how much money I should take . It is all new for me as I have never been to the USA before .
Despite I like to go to nice clothes shops I usually return home with nothing in my hands , as prices are usually to high , unfortunately not affordable for me .
Attituds to the video about life at our school
Thank you in advance for your help . I look forward to receiving your prompt reply .
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping last month ? I must say that was a great fun , I 've never had this kind of experience before . Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets , they are list of pop band and group which will appear in the concert in order , and some information about their performance and backgrounds . After that , I had to help people who had a ticket but ca n't find their seat . During the concert , I did n't have a lot to do , so I had chance to see most of the performance , that was excellent . I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars . During break time I did give a lots of direction to people who ca n't find toilet , and information such as where they could have a cup of coffee . That was bit boring , but it was part of my job .
For me , the best moments for the shopping are two opposite situations .
Finally in my opinion , you should visit the Art Gallery . It will take you two or three hours but it 's a gorgeous place . I look forward hearing from you .
Other thing is that in the ticket apears that discounts were available but when I asked for it , there was no one .
Also , a lot of people were enitieising about the facilities which said to be serve in an advertisement . For example , the discount for the tickets were not available , and especially a lot of people were disappointed that they can not visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed , due to the cleaner forgotten to clean up the mess from the previous party .
Activities connected with the social programme such as international evenings , sing along parties and indoor games .
Lastly , I do n't think that it was my perfect evening . I would like to get my money back .
The next day Pat told me that he wanted to be admired by some girls and so he had to tell them our secret .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
At the same time you are enjoying the castle you can take a breake to go to the beach and you can look at the castle from the sea , it is also amazing . Also , there is a museum of history inside . As you see , you have to visit the castle , you wo n't feel regret about that .
I will definitely go to the festival next year , too . To make it more enjoyable , I would be grateful if you could welcome my comments on it .
On balance I think that evidently technology has got more advantages than disadvantages .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Sofia Jordana
One day before exam , we were so excited and frighten because we were n't ready for exam . We knew that our teacher kept the exam papers in her desk . One of my friend came up with the idea that we had to steal them . The question was who would be the person do this action so we tossed a coin , and the result was me . I was so scare and frighten because if I was caught I would be punished .
Actually this happened because the most things I saw were differend from what the advertisement had been written .
Secondly , thanked to the technology , there are many ways of travelling today . We produce cars , trains and plains which are better and better .
I look forward to hearing from you soon
Those are all my questions . I am looking forward receiving your reply . Please write me soon .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
But what my imagination is that these flats 'll have many functions such as offices , leisure centre , shopping centre even school . Because we are living in computerlised life , so we 'll able to do most things at home or these flats 'll have these places as well .
Firstly , I 'm writing to thank you the great opportunity you give us , especially in planing all this programme in a such acurate way . I think that this programme has a good organisation , as you know , due to we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points . But , I was wondering , like a student of this college , if we would change part of this programme ... we 'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show . It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock . In this way , we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and the , we can go to the show .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
Nowadays , everyone has a mobile phone . I am fifteen years old and everybody in my year has got a mobile phone . Five years ago you would n't have even thought about it . It has been a plus for me . For example , now my parents allow me to go to more places just because I have my mobile with me , and , sending text messages is an addiction which every teenager is obsessed with .
Hello Kim ,
Second , I use to go to Camps where they only used log cabins so I prefer if it is possible to be in tents , because it would be a original experience .
But not everything about shopping is enjoyable . For example , I hate when I get into a shopping centre and it is crowded . I do n't like when I have to try on differents sizes because the small does n't fit on my body because I have got weight . It is in this moment when really I realiase I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling .
Finally . I think that everybody know that the electricity is very important invent and for me it is the best .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
In the first place , some housewifes do n't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second . To make matters worse , you forget to buy something when you get back home . It is very frustrating . Moreover , if you go with your children , you will have to control them and remember things on your list at the same time and sometimes they cry when they want something in the supermarket . It is a tough chore !
Yours sincerely .
So he decided to scare the old woman away from school . Now he thought it was stupid to tell Jon about it , as he was the best friend of Pat . `` Oh , that girl will cause some problems '' - he thought when Miss Colston entered the classroom . She approached the desk and wanted to open it , but suddenly Pat shouted - `` Miss Colston , please , do n't do that . There 's a frog '' . The teacher stared at the whole class and calmly whispered - `` Who did it ? ''

To sum up modern technology changed our daily life . Mine too . I think that I could not live normal life without these inventions . They are like air I breath . I am questioning myselfs - am I sick man ?
After finish the conference , there is a party in same hotel . In this party there are ; some foods , soft drinks , music and a special place for dancing . This party is for the students so the kinds of clouthes wo n't be so formal .
Topical class is similar to speaking and listening but the materials are more up-dated . The teacher use video , pictures to show students about festivals , sports , museums , ect . It is popular by the students .
I wish you were there with me helping at a pop concert . I just loved it , I was working with these music system . You know how good I 'm at music , anyway I was helping to these pop concert to get the corect sounds , at the bigging I was conecting all these wires into spekers , music system , guitar etc ... The particularly bit that I liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar , you know how much I love playing guitar , and all these video cameras were just filming us . I asked on of the camera man when they 're going to show these show on tv , and he told me they 're going to show it on 10 of June , so turn on your tv on these date chanel three , and must seem me there playing with these guitar AH it was lovely . These singers are going to come next year so I want to invite you to my house for one or two weeks to see these pop concert , beleave me you 'll love it and you might use the drums , I told them that you 're really good at drums so they want to try you too .
Angeles .
I look forward to reciving a reply from you .
Thank you very much for your letter that I just got last week . How are you ? I hope you have a nice summer time now . I wondered who had told you about I had helped a pop concert last month . Anyway , it is does n't matter now who had told you , but I was very happy and enjoyed it . Well , I am going to tell you about it .
During the day I helped preparing her room , then she arrived , and I was there to continue helping .
As you know we are in England to learn your language and also your lifestyle , and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discorve this way of your country !
How much can a computer affect your life ? I think it effects more than you think .
Yours sincerely
The stars and artist are from only six countries , and some concerts take place in small halls . I think you should put it in the advertisement . Are there going to be more plays and films next year ?
Yours sincerely ,
First of all , I have to say that the advertisement was totally different of what I saw there . For example , the actors that were announced to take part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , the discounts were not available and the principal point : it started forty five minutes later . Then , to complete this terrible night , the restaurant was closed . I wonder you could explain me why .
Dear Sir ,
Sincerely :
Apart from that I could n't visit the theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed for holidays .
Dear Helen Ryan :
Yours faithfully ,
Afterwards we wanted to go for a pleasent dinner . To our surprise the restaurant was closed because the lack of staff to keep it open .
yours sincerely
Well , I think you will be happy if I tell you something about this book . I read it two months ago and I liked it very much . It 's a sad story but it makes you know a tipe of life that you ca n't imagine that really exists . The old man is a sad person but he loves his live and lives on the beach because he ca n't stay without see the sea for a day .
My name is Marcia Fomalar , I am writting to make you know how disappointed I felt when I went to the musical show of the London theatre .
Conclusion
Skoclow 43-430
I think , if the journalist want to publish the politicians and film stars private life , they should have asked for permission . They deserve to have a private life as everybody .
Shopping is something made , which do not need to be enjoyable . We can analize when shopping is enjoyable , when it is not .
The party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college so the best way to get there is walking . You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes but in my opinion you can wear very cassual .
Lessons attended in the language laboratory .
I look forward for this competition .
I 'll choose to stay in tents , considering that I want to feel the country in a more raw way . And being a photographer during my spare time and a swimmer since I was a child , these will be the activities I 'll like to do while at the camp - I think I am fairly good at doing both things !
First of all , I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook but actually , starting was not Danny Brook but another person .
The conference will start at 7 p.m , the same day we expect , the 18th of June . Our director will make a speech afterwards and there will be a party with some snacks , drinks and music . For the people interested in , there will be also an amusement karaoke .
Suddenly someone broke my window . I had no time to think , I kept one of the pots and hit him in his head . One moment later I called police .
My name is Agripina T. I just recive your letter and I would like to answer and ask some questions . I would like to travel only on July because it 's the only month when I 'm free . On June I have to take some English lessons . I would prefer to live in log cabins because I think they are more comfortable than tents . I do n't really like living in tents . If it 's possible to live in log cabins I 'll be pleased . While I 'm at the Camp , I would like to do two favorite activities which are basketball and singing . I love to play basketball . I 'm not good at it but I try my best . Before I was in a basketball team and I enjoyded a lot . Also I like singing . In future I would like to be a singer . I like this kind of activity . There is something else I would like to ask . At the Camp , is there a free uniform or we will have to wear something spessial ? Also I would like to ask about money . How much money should I take with me ? And is it nesessary to bring money , will we need them ?

Sincerely ,
Dear Mr. Ryan :
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
First of all , the actor was not Danny Brook .
Actually , I think it was right to tell the teachers but not in Pat 's way . It would have been better for both Pat and Jan if they had told the teachers privately and secretly because Tim would have n't known who had told the teachers .
Yours faithfully ,
Love
First of all , shopping can be a good thing if it is a possibility to forget about all the problems you have , even if it is just for a moment . It relieves you from the pressure of life while you are looking for something to buy .
I would like to travel to Camp California only in July because during June I am very busy with my tests . I will do F.C.E in University of Cambridge and other tests in several subjects in my high school .
I have one question to ask you . I have a little brother and I want to know if I could take it with me . He does n't like stay alone at home .
Thirdly , as far as the activities I have to choose , I would prefer swimming as well as tennis . I have gained some experience in playing tennis due to the tennis court that we used to have at home . I do sports a lot so apart from tennis I am a member in our local swimming centre . I can reasure you that gradually I am improving my sports skills .
The concert was in the University in the middle of the field and at the begining when we arrived there were n't many people , only those who had to prepare the stage and the sound and of course us who had the job of serving drinks during the concert .
When she was a girl , Pat used to play spies and detectives games . Her mother gave a book about how to become a spy for her birthday . She had watched all Mission Impossible and gadget , the inspector series .

Do n't miss the chance to visit the hystorical museum , located in the heart of the capital city . A traditional building which was built at the beginning of the century . The hystorical museum is simply a symbol , a proof of what greek have always considered as main principal : their freedom . There are five diffrent floors , each of them presents a diffrent chronical period of greek history , starting from the period before the birth of Juisus and concluding to the revolution of 1967 . The museum provides the visitor with the opportunity to see original pieces of writing , famous paintings having as main subject the revolution of 1821 , and aspects of the greek religion that has always considered to be vital part of greek history . There is a small amount of money that visitors should pay for entry . Inside the museum there is bookshop having a large variety of hystorical books , maps etc .
In addition , everything is now so expensive that you have to compare the prices . You have to find which shop offers you good quality products for a good price . But sometimes some goods are expensive but of a very bad quality . And it is not an easy task if you have to complain about the quality . Most of the time the shop assistant does n't believe you .
I was really pleased to receive at your letter . Unfortunately Richard Brown is ill but I can help you as much as I can . So , I 'm writting to reply for giving all the information you asked for .
Yours Faithfully ,
I would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports I have never praticed before , that means I do not have any experience on the subject .
Thank you very much for your letter . I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions !
Finally , I would like to know some news about you , What have you done ? Be you studing a lot ?
Pat sent to my house a fax with the different alternatives she thought but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the sorprise was ended . But after all the party was great .
I hate shopping but in the other hand sometimes you can have fun at it . In my opinion , it dependes on your mood , your financial ability , off course where you are going to do shopping and what you are going to buy .
Give my love to your family
How has moden technology changed my daily life ? I think that technology have change my life and everybodies life in many ways . Nowadays , technology is everywhere , all over your house , your school , ofice or any place you can be in a city . This technology has help to made my life easier and more exciting , but like everithing had some negative thing .
Moreover , as I had read the advertisement carefully , I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the theater 's restaurant . But for our surprise , it was out of order . At the end of all these circumstances we were so puzzled and disappointed that we decided to make a complaint .

Dear Sir ,
RECOMMONDATIONS
Let me know if he likes it or not and I hope we 'll be able to get together before too long .
Have you ever imaged how this world would be if there was no electric light ? It must have been a big impact on industry , agriculture and our lifestyle . Think about when the electricity in your house got a short circuit . Do you feel uncomfortable ? Could you do anything much without light ?
I think that showing their beauty is one of animal 's basic instincts . I ca n't stand wearing a suit or kit like which has been showed in Starwars !
Dear Ms. Ryan ,
Last week I spent my holiday in London and I 've seen your musical `` Over the rainbow ' in the Circle Theatre and I was really disappointed . When I read the advertisment for the show I was really excited but after the show I was not very happy because of the following problems .
He had a puncture wheel and he did n't know how to repeared then I chanced the wheel and during this time he was asking me for my hobbies , studies , everything . He was really kind and friendly but really what I really most enjoyed of it , was when he invited me this night for a drink in the most luxury pub I have ever been . Could you believe my luck ?
I would like to suggest a change in the programme by giving up shopping and going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
I have never been I California . How is the weather there in July ? What kind of clothes would you recommend taking with me ? Is it possible to pay by credit card or should I prefer to take traveller queckes ?
For accommodation at Camp California I prefer tents , because I use to go tents holidays , I like it .
Jae Hwa . Kim .
I would like to travel in July this year because I think the weather will be nice and I can take a holiday . I would like to use a tent for my accommodation . I think it is more interesting than log cabins . I can be more next nuture and I have never used tents before . It seems to be exciting .
It was dangerous , but I had to do it . I did not have any choice since my brother was in trouble . I had to become a burgler again and steal jewelry from the jewelry shop near by .
I refer to your advertisment in the Herald Tribune where you advertised for the Circle Theatre and the recent musical : Over the Rainbow .
We are looking foraward to hearing from you .
Dear Jane Clark ,
Dear Sir : I am writing to you this letter because I would like you to know about a musical show which I went to see to the Circle Theatre . First of all , I wanted to see this musical 'Over the Rainbow ' because the actor Danny Brook was acting in it . But when the musical started I got very disappointed because Harry Smythe , a not very famous actor , was acting instead of Danny Brook . Then , the musical did n't start on time . It supposed to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour . All the people got very angry . Also I bought a £20 ticket because in the advertisement for the show was put that discounts were available for £10 £15 , £20 tickets . I could n't have my ticket discounted because when I went to buy it they told me that was untrue . Furthermore , in the advertisement was put that the theatre restaurant was opened but when we went there after the show , it was closed because the chief of the restaurant was ill . It was ridiculous ! In conclusion , I did n't have my perfect evening out , in other words , I had a very disappointing evening so I am asking you for my money back . I would like to have my money back in ten days , in the other case , I would have to sue you . I am looking forward to hearing from you . Yours sincerely ,
Yours sincerely ,
In order to write this report , I spent hours in this wonderful museum . There , I saw the exibitions and admired the building itself . I walked around the garden too .
I would like to go to `` Camp California '' on July because I will have to produce `` Mission Impossible III '' from August . I will be busy to decide everything about this film and will not have enough time to go there .
I hope you will not angry if I give you some advice ? At first , I would like to talk about your section `` Stars and Artists '' . This section is really great and attract a lot of people . From my point of view , it will better if you have some `` Stars and Artists '' from only six countries . Because the spectators will probably more interested in your festival if they know the celebrities .
But the play started fourty-five minutes late , and the star of the show , of whom I 'm a great fan an who was the mainly reason of why I decided to see the play , was changed for another actor , how turned out to be really bad .
Finally , about the free three hours , my personal prefer to go shopping . Our city has got the biggest shoping centre in South England , there gathers so many shops . It worthes tp spend time and money on that .
Third , I love playing basketball , I am a great player and I play with my University and I like to be playing all the time so this activity I will not missed . The other activity would be surf . I think is very cool and I want to learn .
First off all I would like to say that modern technology has changed my daily life very much .
Ivan . S .
Plays and films had a great success and I would like to ask if there will be more next year because in my opinion people would appreciate it .
If you need futher information do not hesitate to contact us .
I am writing in reply to your letter , which I have received last week , and in fact I am very surprised and please for the prize .

And what about mobile telephones ? Changes wo n't stop it 's caming the WAP technology ( you 'll buy a cake in a corner 's machine without any coin , only one call ) , digital TV , virtual reality and more ...
Shopping , what an exciting thing !
My name is Manuel Olmez and last week I went to see the musical show 'Over the rainbow ' to the Circle theatre .
To sum up , I am very disappointed about the musical in your theatre . Neither beautiful surranding near your theatre nor comfortable sits will not recompansate my horrible evening . Therefore , I would like you to send my money back , because I think I deserve it as a viewer . I look forward to hearing from you .
On top of everything the tickets did n't offer any discounts , so the last day I could n't buy the present for my neighbour .
Dear Sir/Madam
Yours truly .
In today 's fast moving world young people spend less and less time cooking or eating healthy food . When they are at home , especially children , parents take care of them and always prepare some good dinner with meat or a fresh salad for supper .
I would like to travel in July because , I will be working for the rest of the summer . I would like to stay in a log cabin , since I ca n't sleep in tiny , narrow areas . I have been sailing in the Mediterennean for eight years and I have been playing tennis for four years so I would like to choose sailing and tennis activities .
I was shoked because I had alredy spoken with them and I had taken two autographs .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I must say that being in a concert is very nice . But helping in a concert is much nicer . At the end I realized that all your need is co-operation and do n't think selfishly . Hope to hear from you soon .
I am writing this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday . I do welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving the informations that you have asked me .
I was promised that the starring was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw just other starring that was completely difference from your brochar . To make the matter worse , I was travelling to London to see this famous starring but I did n't see any shows of them . It make me a bit angry .
With best wishes , your
Finally , you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historical places ( castles , builded in 13-th century ) or art gallery , as well as beatiful Bodnant garden .
How has modern technology changed your daily lief .
I would like to answer to you question , please notice that I can travel only in July because only then I can take holidays from my work , after the busy time of month May and June .
Thank you very much for your letter which informed me that I have won the first prize for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A . Here are some information as requested .
When it 's very cold winter , we just wear light clothes what we want , in our style . Because special warm and healthy material will be developed and use them inside thin clothes so we do n't need to put heavy clothes on our bodies . We can show our body line in winter as well .
First of all , I would like to travel on July , because during the other months , I will be studying , preparing myself for other exams or I will be out travelling somewhere else with my relatives .
There is also one thing that I would like to ask You about . The question is : Do I need some extra money and what kind of clothes should I take for this trip ?
Thirdly , we will have the end-of-conference party at 6 p.m. You can have dinner with wine which is very famous in our area and also you can enjoy the semi-classical concert which we have prepared for 3 months . But I hope you will wear formal suit and dress . You will not be allowed to enter this party unless you wear casual clothes . Lastly , you do not have any problem spending your extra time in Cambridge because we have a lot of attraction . Cambridge bus tour , for example , will be very nice time for you because it is the best and the easiest way of knowing Cambridge . But if you do not like it , you can enjoy City centre by walking tour and then you can enjoy going punting which is the most pleasant attraction in Cambridge .
Finally , you would like to know some activities for three hours free time . I think you can go to the 'Dreamland ' . In this place there is video games , some little competitions and small zoo available . Students can enjoy their time in this place and it is on the way of the airport .
And also I want to ask some questions . What clothes should I taken ? How much money should I taken ? And how could we meet at the airport ? I am looking forward your reply .
According to the advertisement , which appeared in one of the London 's newspapers , I would like to present you some of my complaines about your musical spectacle . Firstly , I would like to say that the cast , which you `` offered '' has been changed . The man who played the main male role was different than this one , who was mentioned in the advertisement . Secondly , the time when your musical should start has been changed , making your show delayed for nearlly one hour ! In your offer I noticed an information about discounts which were supposed to be available - no , they were not ! Another `` defect '' in the advertisement was an `` invitation '' to the restaurant after the show . For unknown for me reasons , I found the restaurant closed ( there was no information telling about a cause of closing it ) . Finally , you guaranteed `` a perfect evening out '' , but for me it was the worst visit in theatre in two years time .
As a second point , the actor was not Danny Brook , as displayed , but someone else I 've never had heard of before . His acting and singing was horrible .
One of the most important subject of the media is to inform people bout famous people such as politicians , films stars or successful musicians . In order to fullfill their readers ' requirements they always follow them . This kind of people are known as paparazzi .
The most important development is the internet system which is connected to the whole world 's computers by some telephone liens . You can send a letter to your friend by an e-mail but not writting it on a piece of paper and send it by post . It just takes you a few minutes . How convenience it is ! There are also much more advantages , you can buy somethings in a supermarket by only a mail order , you do n't need to go out of your home .
Who would talk now about enjoyable shopping journeys ? I 'm sure there would be plenty of people ready to do it .
But there is still another point : the theatre restaurant where I had decided having supper was closed , without saying the reason . I had to go back to the hotel , because all restaurants in the area were absolutelly crowded .
Everyday , something changes and we become more modern companies use computers instead of books , dentist use modernized electrical item instead of just a plier , even homes are effected . From letters to emails , from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves , but we are n't just going to stop here are we ? No , in the future , the present will be the past and these things now new to use will be old , outdated and changed .
. What kind of chosen do I have to take
I would be grateful if you could tell me what kind of clothes I have to take with and how many money , more or less , do you think I should take .
I can not imagine how our life would be . We are living in a busy world . In the business world you use the phone all the time to speak with your clients , to make appointments , to order an article e.c . ; then , time is money !
Dear Jean Clark ,
My job it was to accomodate to the people of the main sit of the theathre . Of course those places were reserved just for people well-knowed who wanted to help by joined the concert .
First of all and the most important for me is that you lie to your audience . I did n't see anywhere Danny Brook , but another actor . That it was a big mistake . Unfortunatly your advertisment said that the show starts at 19:30 but it started 45 minutes later . Also there were n't any discounts .
I 'd like to ask for a full refund for this awful night . Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible .
I 've to relax myself to expleint to you this very well .
